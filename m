Right, so it's related to the "garbage code" problem. As mentioned
above, I wasn't aware it was as bad as folks in this thread have
mentioned.

That is an option (and is the one that clone3 went with), but it's a bit
awkward because umode_t is a u16 -- and it would be a waste of 6 bytes
to store it as a u64. Arguably it could be extended but I personally
find that to be very unlikely (and lots of other syscalls would need be
updated).

I'm just going to move the padding to the end and change the error for
non-zero padding to -E2BIG.

This problem is already handled entirely by copy_struct_from_user().

It is true that for some new fields it will be necessary to add a new
flag (such as passing fds -- where 0 is a valid value) but for most new
fields (especially pointer or flag fields) it will not be necessary
because the 0 value is equivalent to the old behaviour. It also allows
us to entirely avoid accepting junk from userspace.
