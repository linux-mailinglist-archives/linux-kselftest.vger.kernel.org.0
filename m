for the ones run outside the kselftest infrastructure.  The content in
the README was largely written by Dave Martin with edits by me.

+This directory contains a mix of tests integrated with kselftest and
+standalone stress tests.
+
+kselftest tests
+===============
+
+sve-probe-vls - Checks the SVE vector length enumeration interface
+sve-ptrace - Checks the SVE ptrace interface
+
+Running the non-kselftest tests
+===============================
+
+sve-stress performs an SVE context switch stress test, as described
+below.
+
+(The fpsimd-stress test works the same way; just substitute "fpsimd" for
+"sve" in the following commands.)
+
+
+The test runs until killed by the user.
+
+If no context switch error was detected, you will see output such as
+the following:
+
+$ ./sve-stress
+(wait for some time)

+Vector length:  512 bits

+Terminated by signal 15, no error, iterations=9350, signals=1039
+
+
+If an error was detected, details of the mismatch will be printed
+instead of "no error".
+
+Ideally, the test should be allowed to run for many minutes or hours
+to maximise test coverage.
+
+
+KVM stress testing
+==================
+
+To try to reproduce the bugs that we have been observing, sve-stress
+should be run in parallel in two KVM guests, while simultaneously
+running on the host.
+
+1) Start 2 guests, using the following command for each:
+
+$ lkvm run --console=virtio -pconsole=hvc0 --sve Image
+
+(Depending on the hardware GIC implementation, you may also need
+--irqchip=gicv3.  New kvmtool defaults to that if appropriate, but I
+can't remember whether my branch is new enough for that.  Try without
+the option first.)
+
+Kvmtool occupies the terminal until you kill it (Ctrl+A x),
+or until the guest terminates.  It is therefore recommended to run
+each instance in separate terminal (use screen or ssh etc.)  This
+allows multiple guests to be run in parallel while running other
+commands on the host.
+
+Within the guest, the host filesystem is accessible, mounted on /host.
+
+2) Run the sve-stress on *each* guest with the Vector-Length set to 32:
+guest$ ./vlset --inherit 32 ./sve-stress
+
+3) Run the sve-stress on the host with the maximum Vector-Length:
+host$ ./vlset --inherit --max ./sve-stress
+
+
+Again, the test should be allowed to run for many minutes or hours to
+maximise test coverage.
+
+If no error is detected, you will see output from each sve-stress
+instance similar to that illustrated above; otherwise details of the
+observed mismatches will be printed.
