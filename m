"get a reference to an object to potentially free it" just sounds all
wrong to me. You free an object when you're *dropping* a reference to
it. Your refcounting scheme doesn't fit my mental models of how normal
refcounting works at all...

So... rules don't take references on the landlock_objects they use?
Instead, the landlock_object knows which rules use it, and when the
landlock_object goes away, it nukes all the rules associated with
itself?

That seems terrible to me - AFAICS it means that if some random
process decides to install a landlock rule that uses inode X, and then
that process dies together with all its landlock rules, the inode
still stays pinned in kernel memory as long as the superblock is
mounted. In other words, it's a resource leak. (And if I'm not missing
something in patch 5, that applies even if the inode has been
unlinked?)

Can you please refactor your refcounting as follows?

 - A rule takes a reference on each landlock_object it uses.
 - A landlock_object takes a reference on the underlying object (just like =
now).
 - The underlying object *DOES NOT* take a reference on the
landlock_object (unlike now); the reference from the underlying object
to the landlock_object has weak pointer semantics.
 - When a landlock_object's refcount drops to zero (iow no rules use
it anymore), it is freed.

That might also help get rid of the awkward ->cleaners thing?

Either way, you are currently using the list_head API in a way that
goes against what the header documents. If you want to rely on
list_del() bringing the object into a specific state, then you can't
leave the comment above list_del() as-is that says that it puts the
object in an undefined state; and this kind of check should probably
be done in a helper in list.h instead of open-coding the check for
LIST_POISON2.
