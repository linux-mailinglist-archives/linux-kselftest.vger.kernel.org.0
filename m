pick_link() (allocation failure of external stack in RCU case, followed
by failure to legitimize the link) is, unfortunately, subtle and nasty.
We *must* path_put() the link; if we'd managed to legitimize the mount
and failed on dentry, the mount needs to be dropped.  No way around it.
And while everything else there can be left for soon-to-be-reached
terminate_walk(), this cannot.  We have no good way to pass what
we need to drop to the place where that eventual terminate_walk()
drops rcu_read_lock().  So we end up having to do what terminate_walk()
would've done and do it right there, so we could do that path_put(link)
before we bugger off.

I'm not happy about that, but I don't see cleaner solutions, more's the
pity.  However, it doesn't mess with ->root - nor should it, since
we don't have LOOKUP_ROOT_GRABBED (not in RCU mode), so it can and
should be left alone.

The only reason why complete_walk() zeroes nd->root in some cases is
microoptimization - we *know* we won't be using it later, so we don't
care whether it's stale or not and can spare unlazy_walk() a bit of
work.  All there is to that one.

I don't see any reason for adding code that would clear nd->root in later
work; if such thing does get added (again, I don't see what purpose
could that possibly serve), we'll need to watch out for a lot of things.
Starting with LOOKUP_ROOT case...  It's not something likely to slip
in unnoticed.
