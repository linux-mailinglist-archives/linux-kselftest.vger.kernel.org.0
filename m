These are all good reasons, thanks for providing the background.

I don't feel I should be in charge of making the decision. I'd still
prefer avoiding the indirect argument structure because

4. it's inconsistent with most other syscalls

5. you get the same problem with seccomp and strace that
   clone3() has -- these and others only track the register
   arguments by default.

6. copying the structure adds a small overhead compared to
   passing registers

7. the calling conventions may be inconvenient for  a user space
   library, so you end up with different prototypes for the low-level
   syscall and the libc abstraction.

I don't see any of the above seven points as a showstopper
either way, so I hope someone else has a strong opinion
and can make the decision easier for you.

In the meantime just keep what you have, so you don't have
to change it multiple times.

       Arnd
