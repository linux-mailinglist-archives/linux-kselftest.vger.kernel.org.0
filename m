I would have to double check. From what I remember cma allocator is an
optimization to increase chances to allocate hugetlb pages when
overcommiting because pages should be normally pre-allocated in the pool
and reserved during mmap time. But even if a hugetlb page is not pre
allocated then this will get propagated as SIGBUS unless that has
changed.

I certainly can. But it doesn't in practice because most allocations
will simply not fail and rather invoke OOM killer directly. Maybe there
are cases which still might fail (higher order, weaker reclaim
capabilities etc) but that would result in a bug in the end because the
#PF handler would trigger the oom killer.

Yeah and that sucks! Because it is leaving us with speculations now. I
hope you do not want to repeat the same mistake now and leave somebody
in the future in the same situation.

A fixed size pool shared by all users of this feature.

Try to do a simple excercise. You have X amout of secret memory. How do
you distribute that to all interested users (some of them adversaries)
based on the above. Global limit is a DoS vector potentially, memcg is a
mixed bag of all other memory and it would become really tricky to
enforece proportion of the X while having other memory consumed and
rlimit is per process rather than per user.

Look at how hugetlb had to develop its cgroup controler to distribute
the pool among workloads. Then it has turned out that even reservations
have to be per workload. Quite a convoluted stuff evolved around that
feature because it turned out that the initial assumption that only few
users would be using the pool simply didn't pass the reality check.

As I've mentioned in other response to James. If the direct map
manipulation is not as big of a problem as most of us dogmatically
believed then things become much simpler. There is no need for global
pool and you are back to mlock kinda model.
