Kyle, sorry this took so long to get to.  I do really appreciate the fix
and the selftest.  This seems like something we want to get merged
sooner rather than later, so please bear with me.

Please always write functions() with parenthesis to make it clear what
you're talking about.  Also, there are much better ways to format this
paragraph.  I probably would have said:

There are three APIs that write PKRU:
1. sigreturn
2. PTRACE_SETREGSET with NT_X86_XSTATE
3. KVM_SET_XSAVE

Then broken it up into three follow-on paragraphs.  I actually kinda had
to do this to even make sense of what you were trying to say above.  It
would also be nice to have a clear problem statement paired with the
mention of these three ABIs.

#1 and #3 work OK, right?  It's #2 that's broken?

> sigreturn still uses XRSTOR to write to PKRU.

... which means?  That sigreturn is fine and does not need to be touched
in this patch?

So this is the bugfix?  KVM already does it right, and we just need to
make ptrace() share the KVM code?

I'm not quite sure what this chunk of the changelog is trying to tell
me.  Isn't this the sigreturn path?  Why did the paragraph above go from
talking about sigreturn to KVM then back to sigreturn?

The implication here is that we would like the sigreturn ABI and the
ptrace ABI to behave in a similar fashion, right?

At a high level, this patch does a *LOT*.  Generally, it's nice when
bugfixes can be encapsulted in one patch, but I think there's too much
going on here for one patch.

I'm not a big fan of hunks that are part of bugfixes where it is not
clear that the hunk is necessary.

I actually hadn't dug into the KVM code around this before.  It seems
like the PKRU pointer (&target->thread.pkru) here can also be
&vcpu->arch.pkru if it comes from the KVM side.

I was missing why PKRU is so special here.  I think in *both* cases,
we're copying a potential PKRU value from userspace.  But, the fpstate
target is a useless place to write PKRU because the kernel doesn't
update from there.  So, the copy-in function
(copy_uabi_from_kernel_to_xstate()) needs a place to stash PKRU where
the kernel will see it.  The place that the kernel wants to stash it is
either the task PKRU field or the KVM vcpu field.  That's what the
pointer provides.

Also, is this getting a wee bit over 80 columns?

This is also changing copy_sigframe_from_user_to_xstate() to take a
'task_struct' instead of an 'fpstate'.  Why?  That function just turns
it right back into an fpstate with: tsk->thread.fpu.fpstate.

I think this function deserves a little comment about what it expects
from 'pkru' here.  Maybe:

/*
 * The kernel will not update the actual PKRU register from the PKRU
 * space in @fpstate.  Allow callers to pass in an alternate destination
 * for PKRU.  This is currently either the pkru field from the

If I read this in 5 years, do I know what the "KVM legacy ABI behavior" is?

This is a bit wonky.  The code kinda pretends that XFEATURE_MASK_PKRU
and 'pkru' are independent.  But, it's actually impossible to have a
pkru==NULL and have XFEATURE_MASK_PKRU set.  The code would oops in that
case.

Would something like this be more clear?

	if (hdr.xfeatures & XFEATURE_MASK_PKRU) {
		struct pkru_state *xpkru;

		xpkru = __raw_xsave_addr(xsave, XFEATURE_PKRU);
		*pkru = xpkru->pkru;
	} else {
		/*
		 * KVM may pass a NULL 'pkru' to indicate
		 * that it does not need PKRU updated.
		 */
		if (pkru)
			*pkru = 0;
	}
