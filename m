Wait until you learn that /proc/$TID thread entries exist but aren't
shown when you do ls -al /proc, only when you explicitly access them.

I think adding both would be potentially useful. How about:

#define PIDFD_SELF		-100
#define PIDFD_THREAD_GROUP	-200

This will make PIDFD_SELF mean current and PIDFD_THREAD_GROUP mean
current->pid_links[PIDTYPE_TGID]. I don't think we need to or should
mirror procfs in any way. pidfds are intended to be usable without
procfs at all.

I want to leave one comment on a bit of quirkiness in the api when we
add this. I don't consider it a big deal but it should be pointed out.

It can be useful to allow PIDFD_SELF or PIDFD_THREAD_GROUP to refer to
the calling thread even for pidfd_open() to avoid an additional getpid()
system call:

(1) pidfd_open(PIDFD_SELF, PIDFD_THREAD)
(2) pidfd_open(PIDFD_SELF, 0)

So if we allow this (Should we allow it?) then (1) is just redundant but
whathever. But (2) is at least worth discussing: Should we reject (2) on
the grounds of contradictory requests or allow it and document that it's
equivalent to pidfd_open(getpid(), PIDFD_THREAD)? It feels like the
latter would be ok.

Similar for pidfd_send_signal():

// redundant but ok:
(1) pidfd_send_signal(PIDFD_SELF,         PIDFD_SIGNAL_THREAD)

// redundant but ok:
(2) pidfd_send_signal(PIDFD_THREAD_GROUP, PIDFD_SIGNAL_THREAD_GROUP)

// weird way to spell pidfd_send_signal(PIDFD_THREAD_GROUP, 0)
(3) pidfd_send_signal(PIDFD_SELF,         PIDFD_SIGNAL_THREAD_GROUP)

// weird way to spell pidfd_send_signal(PIDFD_SELF, 0)
(4) pidfd_send_signal(PIDFD_THREAD_GROUP, PIDFD_SIGNAL_THREAD)

I think all of this is ok but does anyone else have a strong opinion?
