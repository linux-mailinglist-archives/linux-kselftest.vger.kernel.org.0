I have never looked at TAP version 13 in any depth at all, so do not consider
me to be any sort of expert.

My entire TAP knowledge is based on:

  https://testanything.org/tap-version-13-specification.html

and the pull request to create the TAP version 14 specification:

   https://github.com/TestAnything/testanything.github.io/pull/36/files

You can see the full version 14 document in the submitter's repo:

  $ git clone https://github.com/isaacs/testanything.github.io.git
  $ cd testanything.github.io
  $ git checkout tap14
  $ ls tap-version-14-specification.md

My understanding is the the version 14 specification is not trying to
add new features, but instead capture what is already implemented in
the wild.

Greg's response mentions ktest (?) already does nesting.

Version 14 allows nesting through subtests.  I have not looked at what
ktest does, so I do not know if it uses subtest, or something else.

I think you could output a diagnostic line that says a test is starting.
This is important to me because printk() errors and warnings that are
related to a test can be output by a subsystem other than the subsystem
that I am testing.  If there is no marker at the start of the test
then there is no way to attribute the printk()s to the test.

The examples in specification V13 and V14 look very simple and very
readable to me.  (And I am not a fan of YAML.)

If a test generates diagnostic data, then I would expect that to be
the direct result of a test failure.  So the test can output the
"not ok" line, then immediately output the YAML block.  I do not
see a need for stashing YAML output ahead of time.

If diagnostic data is generated before the test can determine
success or failure, then it can be output as diagnostic data
instead of stashing it for later.

YAML serializer sounds like not needed complexity.
