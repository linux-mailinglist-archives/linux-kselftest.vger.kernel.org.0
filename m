Yes, for this we are on the same page. The scenario I want to describe is..=

...target VM can get hw error anytime: before precopy (if cloud
provider is not carefully monitoring the machine health), during
precopy from src to target, during src blackout, during postcopy,
after migration done, and keep running on host. Both MADV_HWPOISON[1]
and hwpoison-inject[2] are subject to hw_memory_failure, so they just
seems unreliable to me: if target is in memory error trouble before or
in early phase of migration, we lose the unpoison feature in kernel.

I don't think CAP_ADMIN is something we can work around: a VMM must be
a good citizen to avoid introducing any vulnerability to the host or
guest.

On the other hand, "Userfaults allow the implementation of on-demand
paging from userland and more generally they allow userland to take
control of various memory page faults, something otherwise only the
kernel code could do." [3]. I am not familiar with the UFFD internals,
but our use case seems to match what UFFD wants to provide: without
affecting the whole world, give a specific userspace (without
CAP_ADMIN) the ability to handle page faults (indirectly emulate a
HWPOISON page (in my mind I treat it as SetHWPOISON(page) +
TestHWPOISON(page) operation in kernel's PF code)). So is it fair to
say what Axel provided here is "provide !ADMIN somehow"?
