Thanks, I appreciate the sentiment. Hopefully we can align here.

Data is useful and expected for changes that aim to improve the
performance of a system in one way or another. That is, after all, the
sole intention of the work, no?

What I'm also looking for is a controlled experiment, where a single
independent variable (e.g. locking) can be evaluated against the
baseline. All-or-nothing data has limited usefulness.

The justification for a series is against the upstream tree, not some
out-of-tree stuff. The cover letter explicitly calls out the decision
to simplify the patch series along with performance data I can reproduce
on my own systems.

This is a perfect example of how to contribute changes upstream.

As I mentioned above, the reasoning is adequately documented and the
discussion that led to v4 is public. OTOH...

        ^~~~~~~~~

If it happened in private then its no better than having said nothing at
all.

Please, keep the conversation on-list next time so we can iron out any
disagreements there. Otherwise contributors are put in a *very* awkward
situation of mediating the on- and off-list dialogue.

No. Sufficient justification is captured in the public review feedback +
series cover letter. Your statement that the approach was changed without
justification is unsubstantiated.

Serious question: are you not receiving my mail or something?

I re-raised my question to you from ages ago about locking on the arm64
MMU. You didn't answer last time, I'd appreciate a reply this time
around.

Otherwise I couldn't be bothered about the color of the Kconfig bikeshed
and don't have anything meaningful to add there. I think the three of
you are trending in the right direction.
