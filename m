Ah, so we are disagreeing about what the right semantics are. ^^ To
me, that is exactly the behavior I would expect.

Imagine that someone wants to write a program that needs to be able to
load libraries from /usr/lib (including subdirectories) and needs to
be able to write output to some user-specified output directory. So
they use something like this to sandbox their program (plus error
handling):

static void add_fs_rule(int ruleset_fd, char *path, u64 allowed_access) {
  int fd =3D open(path, O_PATH);
  struct landlock_path_beneath_attr path_beneath =3D {
    .parent_fd =3D fd,
    .allowed_access =3D allowed_access
  };
  landlock_add_rule(ruleset_fd, LANDLOCK_RULE_PATH_BENEATH,
          &path_beneath, 0);
  close(fd);
}
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  char *output_dir =3D argv[1];
  int ruleset_fd =3D landlock_create_ruleset(&ruleset_attr,
sizeof(ruleset_attr, 0);
  add_fs_rule(ruleset_fd, "/usr/lib", ACCESS_FS_ROUGHLY_READ);
  add_fs_rule(ruleset_fd, output_dir,
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE_FILE|LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_REG|LANDLOCK_ACCESS_F=
S_REMOVE_FILE);
  prctl(PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS, 1, 0, 0, 0);
  landlock_enforce_ruleset_current(ruleset_fd, 0);
}

This will *almost* always work; but if the output directory is
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ , loading libraries from that directory
won't work anymore, right? So if userspace wanted this to *always*
works correctly, it would have to somehow figure out whether there is
a path upwards from the output directory (under any mount) that will
encounter /usr/lib, and set different permissions if that is the case.
That seems unnecessarily messy to me; and I think that this will make
it harder for generic commandline tools and such to adopt landlock.


If you do want to have the ability to deny access to subtrees of trees
to which access is permitted, I think that that should be made
explicit in the UAPI - e.g. you could (at a later point, after this
series has landed) introduce a new EXCLUDE flag for
landlock_add_rule() that means "I want to deny the access specified by
this rule", or something like that. (And you'd have to very carefully
document under which circumstances such rules are actually effective -
e.g. if someone grants full access to $HOME, but excludes $HOME/.ssh,
an attacker would still be able to rename $HOME/.ssh to $HOME/old_ssh,
and then if the program is later restarted and creates the ruleset
from scratch again, the old SSH folder will be accessible.)
