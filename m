I disagree re: "aren't part of the problem space".

Reading small files from procfs was specifically called out in the
rationale for the syscall.

In my experience you're rarely monitoring a single proc file in any
situation where you care about the syscall overhead.  You're
monitoring many of them, and any serious effort to do this efficiently
in a repeatedly sampled situation has cached the open fds and already
uses pread() to simply restart from 0 on every sample and not
repeatedly pay for the name lookup.

Basically anything optimally using the existing interfaces for
sampling proc files needs a way to read multiple open file descriptors
in a single syscall to move the needle.

This syscall doesn't provide that.  It doesn't really give any
advantage over what we can achieve already.  It seems basically
pointless to me, from a monitoring proc files perspective.
