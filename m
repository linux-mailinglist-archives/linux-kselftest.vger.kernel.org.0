Hmm, so the old sentence I think was incorrect already. Notifications
of *the faults* aren't delivered and resolved through the syscall.
Rather, the syscall just gives you a file descriptor, and then
notification / resolution of faults happens though the file
descriptor, not through the syscall. So I think it needs to be
reworded in any case.

I think the overall structure of the doc as-is makes the most sense as
well - first explain how this will be used at a very high level, and
then go into the details (first how to create a userfaultfd, then how
to use it).

So, in the end I reworded the "Creating a userfaultfd" section, to
cover the two things you mentioned:

- Which is the "older" way and which is the "newer" way
- What the benefit of the newer way is

Hopefully this addresses the comment? I can tweak it more if needed.
In any case, thanks for taking a look at this series!

Not 100% sure I understood the concern, but I do think it makes sense
to move "Vmas are not suitable ..." up into the same paragraph with
the other sentence about scalability. I'll do this in v3 as it looks a
bit nicer. This leaves the "The userfaultfd, once created, ..." part
alone, though. I think s/once opened by invoking the syscall/once
created/ is correct, since there are now various ways to create it. I
also think that second comma technically should have been there even
in the previous version.

Hmm, looking at alternatives [1] am not sure I see a viable one:

We could have defined a new "userfaultfdfs" filesystem, but it seems
to me to be overkill for this feature.

We could have used a syscall instead and supported fine-grained access
control with a new capability, but this approach was rejected [2]
generally because we prefer to avoid adding capabilities, and this new
capability's scope (just userfaultfd) was considered too narrow.

So, I'm not sure of another better way to do this. I suppose one could
argue that the dislike of ioctls outweighs the usefulness of this
feature, but to me at least the tradeoff seems worth it. :)

I'll fix this in v3.
