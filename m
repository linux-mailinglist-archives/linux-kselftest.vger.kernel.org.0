Just to clarify, this document tries to define the memory ranges from
where tagged addresses can be passed into the kernel in the context
of TBI only (not MTE); that is for hwasan support. FIXED or GROWSDOWN
should not affect this.

IIUC it doesn't cover it as that's memory mapped by the kernel
automatically on access vs a pointer returned by mmap(). The statement
above talks about how the address is obtained by the user.

Good point. I don't think it can. We may change this for MTE where we
give a hint tag but no hint address, however, this document only covers
TBI for now.

Another good point. Are there any pros/cons here or use-cases? When we
add MTE support, should we handle this differently?

I'd say it's as undefined as it is right now without these patches. We
may be able to explain this better in the document.
