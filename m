No, I saw it.

I'm looking for a branch that is ready to be applied as is - fixups in
the correct place, no debug patches.

That way there's no confusion over exactly what is going in, and we
elimanate a lot of the back and forth.

I shall point my CI at that...

Why is that in the branch? You ran the eytzinger tests, and that's for
code that's self contained that I'm not concerned about running it
myself (and if I did, then we'd be following up on getting it working
with kunit now...)

If you want to leave it in the branch as an informational thing ("yes
these tests were run and here's how"), it should be at the top, not the
bottom, so that when I take it out I still have a subset that's an exact
match (to the sha1) of something you've been working with and testing.
