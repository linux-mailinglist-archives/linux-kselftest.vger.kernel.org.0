Get it, some clients always add another 'Re: ' for a new response, only
one is better, thanks ;-)

Yeah, it did happen, but I can not remember which one, a simple statistic
does show it may be likely:

    $ grep EXPECT_ -ur tools/testing/selftests/nolibc/nolibc-test.c | grep -v define | sed -e 's/.*\(EXPECT_[A-Z0-9]*\).*/\1/g' | sort | uniq -c | sort -k 1 -g -r
         55 EXPECT_EQ
         37 EXPECT_SYSER
         21 EXPECT_SYSZR
         11 EXPECT_SYSNE
          9 EXPECT_VFPRINTF
          4 EXPECT_PTRGT
          4 EXPECT_GE
          3 EXPECT_STRZR
          3 EXPECT_NE
          3 EXPECT_LT
          3 EXPECT_GT
          2 EXPECT_STRNZ
          2 EXPECT_STREQ
          2 EXPECT_PTRLT
          1 EXPECT_SYSER2
          1 EXPECT_SYSEQ
          1 EXPECT_PTRNZ
          1 EXPECT_PTRNE
          1 EXPECT_PTRER2
          1 EXPECT_PTRER
          1 EXPECT_PTREQ

7 helpers are only used by once, another 3 helpers are used twice, and
another 4 are only used by three times.

Me too, but it does help sometimes ;-)

Yes, this may be a better solution to such warnings.

Btw, just thought about gc-section, do we need to further remove dead code/data
in the binary? I don't think it is necessary for nolibc-test itself, but with
'-Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,--print-gc-sections' may be a good helper to show us
which ones should be dropped or which ones are wrongly declared as public?

Just found '-O3 + -Wl,--gc-section + -Wl,--print-gc-sections' did tell
us something as below:

    removing unused section '.text.nolibc_raise'
    removing unused section '.text.nolibc_memmove'
    removing unused section '.text.nolibc_abort'
    removing unused section '.text.nolibc_memcpy'
    removing unused section '.text.__stack_chk_init'
    removing unused section '.text.is_setting_valid'

These info may help us further add missing 'static' keyword or find
another method to to drop the wrongly used status of some functions from
the code side.

It is very easy to add the missing 'static' keyword for is_setting_valid(), but
for __stack_chk_init(), is it ok for us to convert it to 'static' and remove
the 'weak' attrbute and even the 'section' attribute? seems it is only used by
our _start_c() currently.

For the left ones, some are related to libgcc for divide by zero or the other
divide functions, which may be not possible to drop in code side, but for
memmove/memset, it is able to add -ffreestanding in our nolibc-test like -Wall
and only wrap the 'weak' attribute with '#if __STDC_HOSTED__ == 1', for the ARM
specific one, '#ifdef __ARM_EABI__'.

And even further, the '_start_c()' should be 'static' too, perhaps the above
issues are worth a new patchset, If you agree, will send a new patchset to fix
up them.

Thanks,
Zhangjin
