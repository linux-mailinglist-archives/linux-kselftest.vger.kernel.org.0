That sounds like it might be useful down the road, but not to replace
the string_stream.

In regards to the conversation here about string_stream/kunit_stream, I
think Petr already answered that question. As I said previously:

I could potentially use my own set of prbs for that buffering; however,
I think this use case is probably closer to seq_buf than your prb.
Really, I just want some kind of string builder, not a message queue.

The place where I think your prb is relevant here is once I have
composed the message and I just want to print it, having a way to print
it without worrying about context is nice, but I think that is a
separate discussion from the main topic here which was just figuring out
the right way to compose that message in the first place.
