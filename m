Maybe I'm missing something, but what is the issue with

  struct open_how {
    u64 flags;
    u64 resolve;
    u16 mode;
	u64 next_extension;
  } __attribute__((packed));

It was my understanding that __aligned_u64 was used to ensure consistent
layouts, not that it was needed for safety against unaligned accesses.

I would argue that -EINVAL was the wrong choice of return code from the
outset (and if we do keep the padding, I will send a patch to switch it
to -E2BIG -- see below). The purpose of -E2BIG for the newer
"extensible" syscalls is to differentiate between using an unsupported
extension field and an unsupported (or invalid) flag.

This will be useful for a few other extension ideas for these types of
syscalls (related to allowing userspace to more efficiently figure out
what flags are supported by the kernel without having to try each one
separately).

Yeah, though giving it some more thought I think this might be a better
layout to avoid this problem:

  struct open_how {
    __aligned_u64 flags;
    __aligned_u64 resolve;
    __u16 mode;
	__u16 __padding[3]; /* must be zero */
  };

That way, we won't end up with a u16 which we never use (and we won't
have multiple __padding fields in the future).

Yeah, you're quite right -- I was aware that GCC generated "less than
great" code for aligned(1) structures, but wasn't sure whether it would
be seen as being a serious enough issue to NACK the change.

There is an additional problem -- unfortunately, having the struct be
__attribute__((aligned(8))) doesn't solve the Rust representation
problem because Rust can't represent a struct as both being
#[repr(packed)] and #[repr(align(n))]. Obviously the kernel doesn't
really care about Rust language restrictions, but given one of the main
users of how->resolve will be libpathrs, I'd prefer to not make my own
life any harder if possible. ;)

So, given all of the above, I suggest that instead I send something like
this instead:
