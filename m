Ah, indeed, I mistakenly read that as "sgp != SGP_READ".

I'm kind of left thinking along the same lines though.

Modifying shmem_getpage_gfp to behave differently in this case seems
likely to be a can of worms.

With the current behavior, at least it doesn't seem to be too
problematic - we're not going to hand userspace an unzeroed page or
anything. At worst, it's a bit of a rough edge userspace might hit.
The UFFD handler thread will just get an error when it tries to
CONTINUE, and could recover by e.g. writing to the page or something
and trying again.

I'm inclined to leave it as is, and maybe look into a way to file down
the rough edge in a future patch, as well as some of the other
cleanups we've discussed elsewhere. Objections?
