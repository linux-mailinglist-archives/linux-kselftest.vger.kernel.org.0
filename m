No worries. This actually makes me think that we should probably have
some kind of automated test that at least makes sure that popular
KUnit architectures are not broken. Someone is currently adding KUnit
support to KernelCI; maybe we can have KernelCI run multiple
architecture tests after the initial support is complete.

Yeah, that's no good. We need to provide a better experience than
that. David has gotten deeply involved relatively recently: I suspect
that he might have some good insight on this.

David, you mentioned offline that there are some philosophical changes
in how we think about KUnit that has happened that you feel have never
quite been captured in the docs. Do you think this is part of what
Frank has pointed out here? If not, do you have any thoughts about
what we should call this documentation section?

Shuah's first KUnit PR seemed to imply that KUnit was primarily for
UML, or only fully supported under UML. So I think I might be the odd
one out thinking that that has changed and the documentation properly
conveys that.
