I should note we may be able to remove some of the checking, but maybe not =
all.

- Checks that disable page fragging for ppiov can be removed once
ppiov has frag support (in this series or follow up).

- If we use page->pp_frag_count (or page->pp_ref_count) for
refcounting ppiov, we can remove the if checking in the refcounting.

- We may be able to store the dma_addr of the ppiov in page->dma_addr,
but I'm unsure if that actually works, because the dma_buf dmaddr is
dma_addr_t (u32 or u64), but page->dma_addr is unsigned long (4 bytes
I think). But if it works for pages I may be able to make it work for
ppiov as well.

- Checks that obtain the page->pp can work with ppiov if we align the
offset of page->pp and ppiov->pp.

- Checks around page->pp_magic can be removed if we also have offset
aligned ppiov->pp_magic.

Sadly I don't see us removing the checking for these other cases:

- page_is_pfmemalloc(): I'm not allowed to pass a non-struct page into
that helper.

- page_to_nid(): I'm not allowed to pass a non-struct page into that helper=
.

- page_pool_free_va(): ppiov have no va.

- page_pool_sync_for_dev/page_pool_dma_map: ppiov backed by dma-buf
fundamentally can't get mapped again.

Are the removal (or future removal) of these checks enough to resolve this?
