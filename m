The expectation (at least for arm64) is that the main program will only
have shadow stacks if everything says it can support them.  If the
dynamic linker turns them on during startup prior to parsing the main
executables this means that it should turn them off before actually
starting the executable, taking care to consider any locking of features.

Yes, ucontext based coroutines are the sort of thing I meant when I was
talking about returning to a different context? =20

If we don't include it then if different ucontexts have different GCS
features enabled we run into trouble on context switch.

Indeed.  The general model here is that we don't break userspace that
relies on parses the normal stack (so the GCS is never *necessary*) but
clearly you want to have it.
