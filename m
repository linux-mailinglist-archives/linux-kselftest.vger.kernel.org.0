Thank you so much for sending the ZEROPAGE patch. I've rebased my patches
on top of it and my all tests for anon memory are passing. Now we don't
need to touch the page before engaging wp. This is what we wanted to
achieve. So !wp flag can be easily translated to soft-dirty flag
(is_pte_soft_dirty = is_pte_wp).

I've only a few file mem and shmem tests. I'll write more tests.

Lets reconvene in next patches if you feel like they can be improved.
