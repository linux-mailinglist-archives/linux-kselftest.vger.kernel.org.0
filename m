FWIW, I'm starting to look at extending restrictedmem to hugetlbfs and
the separation that the current implementation has is very helpful. Also
helps that hugetlbfs and tmpfs are structured similarly, I guess.

Not an FS expert by any means, but I did think of approaching it this
way as well!

"Hijacking" perhaps gives this approach a bit of a negative
connotation. I thought this is pretty close to subclassing (as in Object
Oriented Programming). When some methods (e.g. fallocate) are called,
restrictedmem does some work, and calls the same method in the
superclass.

The existing restrictedmem code is a more like instantiating an shmem
object and keeping that object as a field within the restrictedmem
object.

Some (maybe small) issues I can think of now:

(1)

One difficulty with this approach is that other functions may make
assumptions about private_data being of a certain type, or functions may
use private_data.

I checked and IIUC neither shmem nor hugetlbfs use the private_data
field in the inode's i_mapping (also file's f_mapping).

But there's fs/buffer.c which uses private_data, although those
functions seem to be used by FSes like ext4 and fat, not memory-backed
FSes.

We can probably fix this if any backing filesystems of restrictedmem,
like tmpfs and future ones use private_data.

Could the solution here be to store private_data of the superclass
instance in restrictedmem, and then override every method in the
superclass that uses private_data to first restore private_data before
making the superclass call? Perhaps we can take private_lock to change
private_data.

(2)

Perhaps there are other slightly hidden cases that might need cleaning up.

For example, one of the patches in this series amends the
shmem_mapping() function from

return mapping->a_ops == &shmem_aops;

to

return mapping->host->i_sb->s_magic == TMPFS_MAGIC;

The former/original is more accurate since it checks a property of the
mapping itself instead of checking a property of the mapping's host's
superblock.

The impact of changing this guard is more obvious if we now override
a_ops but keep the mapping's host's superblock's s_magic.

Specifically for this example, maybe we should handle restrictedmem in
the caller (me_pagecache_clean()) specially, in addition to shmem.

When I was thinking of this I was stuck on handling error_remove_page,
because it was looking up the superblock to iterate over the inodes to
find the right mapping. Glad to see that the solution is simply to use
the given mapping from the arguments!

We don't really need to do this, since rm->file is already the same as
file, we could just pass the file itself when it's needed

I think we probably have to override inode_operations as well, because
otherwise other methods would become available to a restrictedmem file
(like link, unlink, mkdir, tmpfile). Or maybe that's a feature instead
of a bug.

Did you intend this as a check that the backing filesystem isn't using
the private_data field in the mapping?

I think you meant file->f_mapping->private_data.

On this note, we will probably have to fix things whenever any backing
filesystems need the private_data field.
