Sure, and I totally understand that, but as it happens, no one has stepped
up with spare time to do that work. Since you're the person with the need
for the API, it falls to you to do it. And I understand what feature creep
feels like (I needed to fix one design problem[1] with timers, and I spent
months sending hundreds of patches). Some times you get lucky and it's
easy, and sometimes you end up touching something that needs a LOT of work
to refactor before you can make your desired change work well with the
rest of the kernel and be maintainable by other people into the future.

Quick tangent: I can't find in the many many threads where you explain
how large these firmware images are and why existing kernel memory
allocations are insufficient to load them. How large are these[2] files?

/lib/firmware/vk-boot1-bcm958401m2.ecdsa.bin
/lib/firmware/vk-boot2-bcm958401m2_a72.ecdsa.bin

For me, the requirements for partial read support are these things,
which are the characteristics of the existing API:

- the LSM must be able to validate the entire file contents before
  any data is available to any reader. (Which was pointed out back in
  August 2019[3].) And "any" reader includes having a DMA window open
  on the memory range used for reading the contents (which was pointed
  out at by Mimi[4] but went unanswered and remains broken still in this
  v10, but I will comment separately on that.)

- the integrity of the file contents must be maintained between
  validation and delivery (currently this is handled internally via
  disallow_writes()).

Correct -- this is one of the many difficulties of contributing to a
large and complex code base with many maintainers. There can be a lot
of requirements for the code that have nothing to do with seemingly more
narrow areas of endeavour.

My proposed patch series cleans up a number of mistakes that were made
to the kernel_read_file() API, and helps clarify my point about the
enums being used for *what*, and not *how* or *where*, which needs to
be fixed in this series and shouldn't be a big deal (I will reply to
individual patches).

But you are proposing a generic API enhancement that any other user in
the kernel may end up using. Just because the bcm-vk driver is the only
user now, and IMA is the only LSM performing content analysis, it
doesn't mean that there won't be another driver added later, nor another
LSM. In fact, the new BPF LSM means that anything exposed by LSM hooks
is now available for analysis.

Yes, but you're changing kernel_read_file() APIs to do it. There are
plenty of users of that API. Maybe they would like to also use partial
reads?

$ git grep kernel_read_file | wc -l
77

> The above seems outside the scope of my patch?

Unfortunately, it is not. Part of your responsibility as a kernel
developer making API changes/additions is that those changes need to
interact correctly with the rest of the kernel (and be maintainable).

So, while terribly inefficient, I guess this approach is tenable. It
means that each partial read will trigger a full read for LSMs that care
about the hook.

So, to that end, I wonder why IMA doesn't do this for all file types?

It also means that we won't have a strict pairing of
security_kernel_read_file() to security_kernel_post_read_file() in the
LSMs, but it seems that only IMA currently explicitly cares about this
(or maybe not at all).

I'm not entirely happy about using this design, but it does appear
sufficient.

My suggestion quoted here was operating on the idea that whole-file
verification wasn't happening on every partial read, so this isn't a
problem in that case.

Right, this won't be hard. I will send a v2 of my patches to clarify the
purpose of the 3 file content hooks (load_data, read_file,
post_read_file), which might need renaming...

Correct.

So, given that Mimi is (I think?) satisfied with your approach here, I
can't realistically complain. I still don't like the idea of each LSM
needing to perform it's full read loop for the contents, but so be it:
IMA will have the code, SELinux doesn't care (yet), and LoadPin doesn't
care about contents.
