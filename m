IMA currently measures and verifies the firmware file signature on the
post hook.  The file is read once into a buffer.  With this change,
IMA would need to be on the pre hook, to read the entire file,
calculating the file hash and verifying the file signature.  Basically
the firmware would be read once for IMA and again for the device.
