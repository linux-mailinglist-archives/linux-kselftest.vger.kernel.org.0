What are your plans for how to determine when to split THP and to what order? I
don't see anything in this series that would split anon THP to non-zero order?

We have talked about using hints from user space in the past (e.g.  mremap,
munmap, madvise, etc). But chrome has a use case where it temporarily mprotects
a single (4K) page as part of garbage collection (IIRC). If you eagerly split on
that hint, you will have lost the benefits of the large folio when it later
mprotects back to the original setting.

I guess David will suggest this would be a good use case for the khugepaged-lite
machanism we have been talking about. I dunno - it seems wasteful to split then
collapse again.

Or perhaps you're considering doing something clever in deferred split?
