As I understood the original discussion of the proposal on IRC, it was
only one-way (from shadow to normal). Unless I'm missing something,
making it one-way is necessary to catch situations where the shadow
stack would become compromised.

Why would they be sharing a shadow stack?

Indeed, I'm not talking about programs with JIT/manual stack-switching
asm, just anything using existing APIs for control of stack --
pthread_setstack, makecontext, sigaltstack, etc.

If clone is called with signals masked, it's probably not necessary
for the kernel to set the shadow stack register as part of clone3.

One reasonable thing to do, that might be preferable to overengineered
solutions, is to disable shadow-stack process-wide if an interface
incompatible with it is used (sigaltstack, pthread_create with an
attribute setup using pthread_attr_setstack, makecontext, etc.), as
well as if an incompatible library is is dlopened. This is much more
acceptable than continuing to run with shadow stacks managed sloppily
by the kernel and async killing the process on OOM, and is probably
*more compatible* with apps than changing the minimum stack size
requirements out from under them.

The place where it's really needed to be able to allocate the shadow
stack synchronously under userspace control, in order to harden normal
applications that aren't doing funny things, is in pthread_create
without a caller-provided stack.
