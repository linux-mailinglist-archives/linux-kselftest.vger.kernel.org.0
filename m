I didn't know about clear_user() -- I will switch to it.

Yeah, I originally used "max(ksize, usize) - size" for that reason but
was worried it looked too funky (and some quick tests showed that abs()
gives the right results in most cases -- though I just realised it would
probably not give the right results around SIZE_MAX). I'll switch back.

I'm not sure I agree that the limit is in place *forever* -- it's
generally not a break in compatibility to convert an error into a
success (though, there are counterexamples such as mknod(2) -- but that
was a very specific case).

You're right that it would mean that some very new code won't run on
very ancient kernels (assuming we ever pass around structs that
massive), but there should be a reasonable trade-off here IMHO.

If we allow very large sizes, a program could probably DoS the kernel by
allocating a moderately-large block of memory and then spawning a bunch
of threads that all cause the kernel to re-check that the same 1GB block
of memory is zeroed. I haven't tried, but it seems like it's best to
avoid the possibility altogether.

> linux-api folks, WDYT?

Regarding the order, I just copied what sched and perf already do. I
wouldn't mind doing it the other way around -- though I am a little
cautious about implicitly making guarantees like that. The syscall that
uses copy_struct_to_user() might not want to make that guarantee (it
might not make sense for them), and there are some -E2BIG returns that
won't result in data being copied (usize > PAGE_SIZE).

As for feedback, this is syscall-dependent at the moment. The sched and
perf users explicitly return the size of the kernel structure (by
overwriting uattr->size if -E2BIG is returned) for copies in either
direction. So users arguably already have some kind of feedback about
size issues. clone3() on the other hand doesn't do that (though it
doesn't copy anything to user-space so this isn't relevant to this
particular question).

Effectively, I'd like to see someone argue that this is something that
they would personally want (before we do it).

Even though it is "just" min(ksize, usize), I don't see any harm in
returning it. Will do.

Yeah, I'll drop it. You could use them for ioctl()s but we can always
add EXPORT_SYMBOL() later.

I will keep that in mind.
