Sorry, I must have overlooked the B instead of A instance - otherwise 
I would have objected against it - in addition to the recognizability 
and portability issue I think it is important that these primitives are
not unnecessary long since they will be written a *lot* of times if things go 
our way.

And the reason for using unique names elsewhere is to be able to co-exist with
other components with the same needs. In the case of tests, I believe they are 
in a different category, they are not supposed to be part of production kernels,
and we want them to be used all over, that should warrant having the ASSERT_ and EXPECT_
prefixes "reserved" for the purpose, so I would urge some pragmatism here!

Using a similar syntax is a good thing, since it makes it easier for people
who write tests in user land frameworks to contribute to the kernel tests.
And if, lets say, someone later comes up with a way to run the KUnit tests in "real" 
user land within Googletest ;-) then less editing would be needed..

I was thinking of moves between KUnit tests and KTF tests, kernel code only.
Some test functions may easily be usable both in a "pure" mocking environment
and in an integrated setting with hardware/driver/userspace dependencies.

I think the importance of a well thought through 
test API definition is not to be underestimated 
- the sooner we can unify and establish a common base, the better, 
I think.

My other concern is, as mentioned earlier, whether UML is really that 
different from just running in a VM wrt debugging support, and that 
there exists a better approach based on automatically generating 
an environment where the test code and the source under test 
can be compiled in a normal user land program. But it seems 
there are enough clients of the UML approach to justify it 
as a lightweight entry. We want to make it easy and inexcusable 
not to test the code, having a low bar of entry is certainly good. 
Other than that, I really would need to spend some more time with 
the details on KUnit to verify my so far fairly 
shallow observations!

Thanks,
Knut
