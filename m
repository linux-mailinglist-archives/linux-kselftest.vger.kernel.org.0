Merging with your other response:

<quote: https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/87o8o6vvt0.fsf@nanos.tec.linutronix.de/>
Only from #PF, but after the fault has been resolved and the tasks is
scheduled in again then the task returns through idtentry_exit() to the
place where it took the fault. That's not guaranteed to be on the same
CPU. If schedule is not aware of the fact that the exception turned off
stuff then you surely get into trouble. So you really want to store it
in the task itself then the context switch code can actually see the
state and act accordingly.
</quote>

I think, after fixing my code (see below), using idtentry_state could still
work.  If the per-cpu cache and the MSR is updated in idtentry_exit() that
should carry the state to the new cpu, correct?

The exception may have turned off stuff but it is a bug if it did not also turn
it back on.

Ie the irq should not be doing:

	kmap_atomic()
	return;

... without a kunmap_atomic().

That is why I put the WARN_ON_ONCE() to ensure the ref count has been properly
returned to 0 by the exception handler.

FWIW the fixed code is working for my tests...

<sigh>  I am so stupid.  I was not looking at this particular case but you are
100% correct...  I can't believe I did not see this.

In the above statement I was only thinking about the extra overhead I was
adding to idtentry_enter() and the callers of it.

"C programming basics" indeed... Once again sorry...

The problem is with the kmap code.  If an exception handler calls kmap_atomic()
[more importantly if they nest kmap_atomic() calls] the kmap code will need to
keep track of that re-entrant call.  With a separate reference counter, the
kmap code would have to know it is in irq context or not.

Here I'm attempting to make the task 'current->dev_page_access_ref' counter
serve double duty so that the kmap code is agnostic to the context it is in.

And the above probably would work if I knew how to code in C...  :-/  I'm so
embarrassed.

I think you are correct.  I'm testing now...

Peter made the same comment so I've changed to __always_inline.

I don't understand.  I'm not calling it within intrumentation_{begin,end}() so
does that mean I can remove the noinstr?  I think I can actually.

No thank you...  I'm really sorry for wasting every ones time on this one.

I'm still processing all your responses so forgive me if I've missed something.
And thank you so much for pointing out my mistake.  That seems to have fixed
all the problems I have seen thus far.  But I want to think on if there may be
more issues.

Thank you,
Ira
