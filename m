Well I disagree because it does explain how the race can happen, and it
also explains how since the sysfs interface is exposed until module
removal completes, it leaves exposed knobs to allow re-initializing of a
struct zcomp for a zram device before the exit.

Reproducing for me is... extremely easy.

That's to address the deadlock only.

Yes, and as the cpu multistate hotplug documentation warns (although
such documentation is kind of hidden) that driver authors need to be
careful with module removal too, refer to the warning at the end of
__cpuhp_remove_state_cpuslocked() about module removal.

Right and if a syfs knob is exposed before device_del() completely
and is allowed to do things, the driver should take care to prevent
races for CPU multistate support. The small state machine I added ensures
we don't run over any expectations from cpu hotplug multistate support.

I've *never* suggested there cannot be alternatives to my solution with
the small state machine, but for you to say it is incorrect is simply
not right either.

Right, there are two approaches here:

a) Your approach is to accept the deadlock as a requirement and so
you would prefer to implement an alternative to using a shared lock
on module exit and sysfs op.

b) While I address such a deadlock head on as I think this sort of locking
be allowed for two reasons:
   b1) as we never documented such requirement otherwise.
   b2) There is a possibility that other drivers already exist too
       which *do* use a shared lock on module removal and sysfs ops
       (and I just confirmed this to be true)

By you only addressing the deadlock as a requirement on approach a) you are
forgetting that there *may* already be present drivers which *do* implement
such patterns in the kernel. I worked on addressing the deadlock because
I was informed livepatching *did* have that issue as well and so very
likely a generic solution to the deadlock could be beneficial to other
random drivers.

So I *really* don't think it is wise for us to simply accept this new
found deadlock as a *new* requirement, specially if we can fix it easily.

A cursory review using Coccinelle potential issues with mutex lock
directly used on module exit (so this doesn't cover drivers like zram
which uses a routine and then grabs the lock through indirection) and a
sysfs op shows these drivers are also affected by this deadlock:

  * arch/powerpc/sysdev/fsl_mpic_timer_wakeup.c
  * lib/test_firmware.c

Note that this cursory review does not cover spin_lock uses, and other
forms locks. Consider the case where a routine is used and then that
routine grabs a lock, so one level indirection. There are many levels
of indirections possible here. And likewise there are different types
of locks.

Indeed but with your patch it can get stuck and cannot be taken out of this
state.

Try a bit harder, cancel the scripts after running for a while randomly
(CTRL C a few times until the script finishes) and have them race again.
Do this a few times.

With my patch this issues does not happen.
