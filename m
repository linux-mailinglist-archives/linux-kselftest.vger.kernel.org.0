Right I get that, I was just saying that the implicit limitation in x86 is
due to virtual addresses _having_ to be less than 48 bits. So that's why
that is right? I mean perhaps I'm mistaken?

Or is it such that x86 can provide a space for tagging for CPU technology
that supports it (UAI perhaps?).

I agree with what Michal and others said about the decision to default to
the reduced address space size and opt-in for higher bits. Your series
doesn't do this...

To me it's the only feasible way forward, you can't control all libraries,
a map flag continues to seem a strange way to implement this, and I
understand that your justification is that it is the _least invasive_ way
of doing this, but as I've said below, it's actually pretty invasive if you
think about it, the current implementation seems to me to be insufficient
without having VMA flags etc.

I get that, but as I say below, I don't think a customisable limit is
workable.

So I was trying to find a compromise that _might_ be more workable.

OK so this is at least some possible road forward given there is quite a
bit of push-back to alternatives.

I mean maybe I wasn't direct enough - I oppose the current proposal as-is.

I realise, and as I said below, I don't think your implementation is
correct in this form.

Also if you can control everything + for whatever reason can _absolutely
know_ no program will use a FFI or a 3rd party library or whatever that
mremap()'s, I don't see why you can't use mmap() in a creative way to solve
this rather than adding maintenance burden.

A couple ideas:

1. mmap(high_address - domain_size - buffer, ..., PROT_NONE, MAP_FIXED,
   ...) a vast domain. You will almost certainly get the hint you
   want. Then mprotect() regions to PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE as you use (or
   even mmap() with MAP_FIXED_REPLACE over them), all will have high bits
   clear.

2. (suggested by Liam separately) mmap() with PROT_NONE addresses in the
   higher range, which prevents mmap() or any other means of allocating
   memory from allocating there. Acting as a 'huge guard page'.

Neither require any changes.

You kinda can't have it both ways - if you are absolutely controlling all
allocations with no risk of a 3rd party library doing an allocation outside
of this - then you can just use existing mechanics.

If you don't, then MAP_BELOW_HINT is insufficient.

You're taking up a MAP_ flag (in short supply) which we have to maintain
forever across all arches and have to respect a limited map range.

And everything in this realm has edge cases. I don't see how you can
implement this correctly or usefully without a VMA flag, and see below for
my concerns on that.

This is UAPI (and really UABI) so this is _forever_. The bar is high. To me
this proposal does not hit that, and as you keep saying this isn't even
what you want.

You want something per-process so I think the correct proposal is
per-process.

A configurable per-process thing is horrible in itself, so I think the only
workable proposal is a fixed personality.

Right so to me this rules out the MAP_BELOW_HINT. And makes this
implementation invalid.

What's "too low"? This will vary by arch too right? Keep in mind this is

This is more acceptable. It avoids pretty much all of the rest of the
issues.

I just wrote a bunch above about this and did in the original email.

The 48-bit limit is much more workable and is across-the-board so it's easy
to implement. It's the variable thing or map flag thing that's the problem.

I'm against this implementation, or one with a variable limit.

An ADDR_LIMIT_48BIT personality I think is the most workable form of
this. Others may have opinions on this also, but it avoids pretty much all
of the aforementioned issues and is the least invasive.

Sorry to push back so much on your series, your efforts are appreciated, I
am simply trying to head off issues in the future especially those that end
up exposed to userland! :)
