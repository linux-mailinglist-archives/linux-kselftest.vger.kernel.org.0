Yeah, I can't think of any reason that you haven't outlined already
why that might not work, but that seems kind of like circumventing
Linus.

My understanding, based on what I have been told, is that we were
simply unlucky with the timing when Linus pulled the branch in the
first week of the 5.4 merge window (Friday), such that once I fixed
the directory naming issue, the updated changes didn't spend enough
time in linux-next. And now with this issue fixed and KUnit back in
linux-next, if nothing interesting happens between now and 5.5, it
will be accepted in the 5.5 merge window. I do not think that anyone
is expecting anymore changes before merging.

Shuah, Linus, is my understanding correct?

Yeah, that seems even worse. I'm sorry to have caused this frustration.

Okay, that's what I thought (and what I hoped) you were saying :-)

I hope we can figure out something that will work for you. Or
otherwise that you won't mind waiting until 5.5.

Sorry
