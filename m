No, I do not "keep ignoring my main observation".  You made that
observation in an email of Thu, 9 May 2019 09:35:51 -0400.  In my
reply to Tim's reply to your email, I wrote:

   "< massive snip >

   I'll reply in more detail to some other earlier messages in this thread
   later.

   This reply is an attempt to return to the intent of my original reply to
   patch 0 of this series."


I have not directly replied to any of your other emails that have made
that observation (I may have replied to other emails that were replies
to such an email of yours, but not in the context of the overhead).
After this email, my next reply will be my delayed response to your
original email about overhead.

And the "mommy, he hit me first" argument does not contribute to a
constructive conversation about a kernel patch submittal.

I have mentioned before that the in-kernel kselftest tests can be
run in UML.  You simply select the configure options to build them
into the kernel instead of building them as modules.  Then build
a UML kernel and execute ("boot") the UML kernel.

This is exactly the same as for KUnit.  No more overhead.  No less
overhead.  No more steps.  No fewer steps.

No, I agree that fast test execution is useful.

I have not been talking about running scripts, other than to the extent
that _one of the ways_ the in-kernel kselftests can be invoked is via
a script that loads the test module.  The same exact in-kernel test can
instead be built into a UML kernel, as mentioned above.
