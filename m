If I read the code correctly, the last page should always be in `cur`
and on failure only a single page is needed to be backed out. Did I
miss something?

In this case it means that on (intermittent) allocation error we get
inconsistent or non-deterministic results. I wouldn't want to be the
one debugging this later - I'd prefer either the syscall be
"exception-safe" (give consistent and predictable output) or kill the
process.
