This latter section is about the privilege model for
ioctl(PROCFS_GET_PID_NAMESPACE), not the pidns=3D mount flag. pidns=3D
requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN for pidns->user_ns, in addition to the same
restrictions as pidns_install() (must be a direct ancestor). Maybe I
should add some headers in this cover letter for v2...

For the ioctl -- if the user can ptrace-read pid1 in the pidns, they can
open a handle to /proc/1/ns/pid which is exactly the same thing they'd
get from PROCFS_GET_PID_NAMESPACE.

As for the ancestor check (for the ioctl), the logic I had was that
being in an ancestor pidns means that you already can see all of the
subprocesses in your own pidns, so it seems strange to not be able to
get a handle to their pidns. Maybe this isn't quite right, idk.

Ultimately there isn't too much you can do with a pidns fd if you don't
have privileges to join it (the only thing I can think of is that you
could bind-mount it, which could maybe be used to trick an
administrative process if they trusted your mountns for some reason).

> CAP_SYS_ADMIN seems about right.

For pidns=3D, sure. For the ioctl, I think this is overkill.
