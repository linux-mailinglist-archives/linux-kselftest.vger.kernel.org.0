OK, increasing the level of nesting.  Got it.  Does that just apply for
the EL1 registers given that there's no _user S1PIE registers so no
existing check there?

Should we also be doing a similar thing for features that depend on TCR2
- currently that's just PIE but it'll grow?  Probably only when we get
more features rather than now since we don't currently check if the
guest has TCR2, just the system.

OK, to be clear here "it" is GCSCRE0_EL1, not GCSPR_EL1 and GCSCR_EL1
which are for EL1?

Ah, that'd be good - not only for the optimistation but also since at
the minute it's a bit unclear why there are separate EL0/1 functions.

See below, to be clear the only bit I was querying here was:

TBH it'd probably good to have that whole list in the kernel somewhere.

Ah, I think I see.  I would not have interpreted this as making
everything explicit, to me this makes all the writeable fields writeable
implicitly through them just not being mentioned.  For everything to be
explicit I would expect to see a direct, visible reference in the code
to every single field rather than something like we have here where some
of the fields are not mentioned directly.  The end result is an explicit
value but that's true for any use of ID_WRITABLE().

If my understanding is correct then were I writing the bit I quoted
above I'd probably just drop the "explicitly" from that bullet point due
to the handling of simple writable fields with ID_WRITABLE(), the key
point being that every field needs to be handled with the other points
enumerating the specific options for how each field might be handled.
Does my understanding sound correct?

That was me trying to reconcile my understanding of you asking to make
everything explicit with the code as it is.  I suppose the advantage
would be documentation.
