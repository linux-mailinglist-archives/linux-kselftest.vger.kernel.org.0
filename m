Sorry, that's the original commit message - the original version of this
also had support for controlling landing pads but I don't need that and
cut them out of the series.  I forgot to update that bit of the commit
message.

I have no strong opinion on naming here.  _MODE?  I didn't find any
discussions around this in the=20

I did see that the x86 implementation required a call per flag, the
logic wasn't hugely obvious there - it didn't seem super helpful.
There's nothing stopping userspace turning one flag at a time if it
wants to, we just don't require it.  I wasn't overly concerned about the
rollback logic since I was anticipating that the main complexity is the
base enable and allocate, everything else would just be storing a mode.

We can implement things with the one bit per call approach, I just
didn't see much upside to it.  Perhaps I'm missing some case though.

We could add either a second argument with the lock or a separate lock
prctl() and matching query which takes the same bitmask, being able
to lock per feature does give more flexibility to userspace in how we do
the locking and isn't hugely more costly to implement.  My model for
locking had been that there would be a final decision on what the
features should be, I was modelling "can enable" as equivalent access to
"is enabled" when it came to what was locked.

For arm64 we need to add a regset to expose the GCS pointer anyway so
the GCS mode is in there, though at the minute we prevent any changes at
all via that mechanism it could be implemented later.  I'm not aware of
any way for prctl() to tell if it is being invoked via ptrace so that'd
need to be dealt with somehow.

The implementation is in "arm64/gcs: Implement shadow stack prctl()
interface", it just boils down to turning on or off a register bit.

Other than the issue with CRIU I don't see any huge difficulty.
