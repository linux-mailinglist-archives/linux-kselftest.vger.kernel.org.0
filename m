They are in two different categories. Kselftest falls into black box
regression test suite which is a collection of user-space tests with a
few kernel test modules back-ending the tests in some cases.

Kselftest can be used by both kernel developers and users and provides
a good way to regression test releases in test rings.

KUnit is a white box category and is a better fit as unit test framework
for development and provides a in-kernel testing. I wouldn't view them
one replacing the other. They just provide coverage for different areas
of testing.

I wouldn't view KUnit as something that would be easily run in test 
rings for example.

Brendan, does that sound about right?
