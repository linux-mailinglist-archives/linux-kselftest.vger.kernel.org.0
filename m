Jann, how do you see a private mapping being exploited this way? My
mental model of the attack depends on a malicious process tricking a
victim process -- i.e. setting it executable and then gaining exec
control of the victim to point into the buffer. An attack on a private
mapping would require a way to trick the process into making the mapping
executable (which seems a high barrier) first.

Ah, okay, I thought it would be pretty "early" in the VMA logic. i.e.
asking the question "Can I make this executable?" I was expecting to be
common across the VMA regardless of private/shared. I will need to go
read the code more carefully.

Still, it seems nicer to me if the "can this be made executable in the
future" question doesn't matter on sharing, just from a perspective of
least surprise.
