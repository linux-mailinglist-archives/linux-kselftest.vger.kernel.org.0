I agree with most of the above, but all that nightmate^Wcomplexity is
handled on the remote attestation side. If I understand the current
discussion, it's about how to abstract a guest attestation evidence
generation request in a vendor agnostic way. And I think what's proposed
here is simply to pass a binary payload (The evidence request from the
guest userspace) to the kernel key subsystem, hook it into vendor
specific handler and get userspace an attestation evidence (a platform
key signed blob) back to the guest app. The guest app can then give that
to an attestation service, and that's when all the above described
complexity takes place. Am I missing something?

AFAIU, that's not part of the proposal/PoC/mockup. It's all about
funneling an attestation evidence request down to the TSM/PSP/firmware
for it to generate an actually verifiable attestation evidence.
