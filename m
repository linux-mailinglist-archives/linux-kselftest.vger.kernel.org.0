Putting my pragmatic operations hat on, it isn't just the impact on
multiple LSM's.

The security vendors, CrowdStrike's Falcon comes immediately to mind,
are installing BPF hooks as part of their agent systems.

Given that the issue of signing BPF programs is still an open
question, allowing the ability of a BPF program to modify the security
capabilities of a process opens the door to supply chain attacks that
would seem unbounded in scope.

On the other side of the fence, installing a BPF program is a
privileged operation.  If a decision is made to allow that kind of
privilege on a system the argument can be made that you get to keep
both pieces.

Of course that needs to be paired against the fact that system's
administrators are not given any choice as to the wisdom of that type
of permission being afforded to security applications.

Best wishes for a productive remainder of the week.

As always,
