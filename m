Kirill is actually interested in the sealing path for his KVM code so
we took a look.  There might be a two line overlap in memfd_create for
the seal case, but there's no real overlap in memfd_add_seals which is
the bulk of the code.  So the best way would seem to lift the inode ...
-> seals helpers to be non-static so they can be reused and roll our
own add_seals.

I can't see a use case at all for hugetlb support, so it seems to be a
bit of an angels on pin head discussion.  However, if one were to come
along handling it in the same way seems reasonable.

You don't understand why container guarding technology doesn't like
ioctls?  The problem is each ioctl is the multiplexor is specific to
the particular fd implementation, so unlike fcntl you don't have global
ioctl numbers (although we do try to separate the space somewhat with
the _IO macros).  This makes analysis and blocking a hard problem for
container seccomp.

You mean what were the ioctl flags in the patch series linked above? 
They were SECRETMEM_EXCLUSIVE and SECRETMEM_UNCACHED in patch 3/5. 
They were eventually dropped after v10, because of problems with
architectural semantics, with the idea that it could be added back
again if a compelling need arose:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-api/20201123095432.5860-1-rppt@kernel.org/

In theory the extra flags could be multiplexed into the memfd_create
flags like hugetlbfs is but with 32 flags and a lot already taken it
gets messy for expansion.  When we run out of flags the first question
people will ask is "why didn't you do separate system calls?".
