It's my understanding (and please correct if I'm wrong) that when a 
kselftest is shipped with a config file, that config file should be 
treated as a requirement for the test and the user is expected to use it
(running make kselftest-merge). I agree the script shouldn't blow up if
the user doesn't though, so it still makes sense to gracefully skip the
test when the requirements are not met.

This makes me realize that I should probably put these in the config
too:

CONFIG_MODULES=y
CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD=y

Adding --first-time (you meant --first-time, right?) definitely makes
sense, thanks for the pointer. I think having the modules being built-in
should be treated as a skip, same as when they are not there at all.

So something like this:

 for sample in "${rust_sample_modules[@]}"; do
-    if ! /sbin/modprobe -n -q "$sample"; then
+    if ! /sbin/modprobe -n -q --first-time "$sample"; then
         ktap_skip_all "module $sample is not found in /lib/modules/$(uname -r)"
         exit "$KSFT_SKIP"
     fi

will cover both cases.

I think it's safe to assume no other module will depend on the sample
rust modules, so is there any other reason unloading the modules 
might fail apart from MODULE_UNLOAD not being enabled? If not, then I
think we should just check if the removal worked and continue/skip the
test accordingly.

I can't just simply skip all tests like this though:

 for sample in "${rust_sample_modules[@]}"; do
     if /sbin/modprobe -q "$sample"; then
-        /sbin/modprobe -q -r "$sample"
+        if ! /sbin/modprobe -q -r "$sample"; then
+            ktap_skip_all "Failed to unload module $sample, please enable CONFIG_MODULE_UNLOAD"
+            exit "$KSFT_SKIP"
+        fi
         ktap_test_pass "$sample"
     else
         ktap_test_fail "$sample"

as the test plan has already been printed by then.
I'll need to rework the script a bit to skip the test upon errors on 
module removal.

When rust is not enabled, no sample module is enabled either so the test
would still catch this in the first `if ! /sbin/modprobe -n -q --first-time
"$sample"` block and exit with the skip code.

If we need more granularity on the feedback provided to the user (i.e.
indication on what particular options are missing), then I guess we 
could check the current kernel config (/proc/config.gz) and skip the
entire test if any required config is missing. However, this adds an 
extra dependency on CONFIG_IKCONFIG=y and CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC=y.

Any advice on the best approach here?

Kselftest exit codes are predefined
(https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/tools/testing/selftests/kselftest.h?h=v6.8-rc6#n74),
so if we use `set -e` and source a missing file we end up returning "1"
as if the test was run and failed. With this check we're sure to return
a value that makes sense in the event the helpers file ever gets moved.

Sure, checking the return value for source also makes sense.

Thanks!
