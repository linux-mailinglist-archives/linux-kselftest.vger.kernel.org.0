This is one of the things I had in mind recently.

Even better, we can stop advertising TSC_ADJUST in CPUID to the guest 
and forbid it from writing it at all.

And if the guest insists and writes to the TSC itself, 
then indeed let it keep both pieces (or invoke some failback code).
 
I have nothing against this solution.
