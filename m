Hi Jann,

Thanks for your feedback and for taking the time to review these
patches!

Not that I'm aware of. The reason why I made this seal have semantics
where it prevents future executable mappings is because there are
existing applications that allocate an ashmem buffer (default
permissions are RWX), map the buffer as RW, and then restrict
the permissions to just R.

When the buffer is mapped as RW, do_mmap() unconditionally sets
VM_MAYEXEC on the VMA for the mapping, which means that the mapping
could later be mapped as executable via mprotect(). Therefore, having
the semantics of the seal be that it prevents any executable mappings
would break existing code that has already been released. It would
make transitioning clients to memfd difficult, because to amend that,
the ashmem users would have to first restrict the permissions of the
buffer to be RW, then map it as RW, and then restrict the permissions
again to be just R, which also means an additional system call.

For SELinux policy, do you mean to not allow execmem permissions? What
about scenarios where a process wants to use JIT compilation, but
doesn't want memfd data buffers to be executable? My thought was to use
this new seal to have a finer granularity to control what buffers can
be mapped as executable. If not, could you please clarify?

Also, F_SEAL_EXEC just seals the memfd's current executable permissions,
and doesn't affect the mapping permissions at all. Are you saying that
F_SEAL_EXEC should be extended to cover mappings as well? If so, it is
not clear to me what the semantics of that would be.

For instance, if a memfd is non-executable and F_SEAL_EXEC is applied,
we can also prevent any executable mappings at that point. I'm not sure
if that's the right thing to do though. For instance, there are shared
object files that don't have executable permissions, but their code
sections should be mapped as executable. So, drawing from that, I'm not
sure if it makes sense to tie the file execution permissions to the
mapping permissions.

There's also the case where F_SEAL_EXEC is invoked on an executable
memfd. In that case, there doesn't seem to be anything to do from a
mapping perspective since memfds can be mapped as executable by
default?

Sorry, I used this example about write permission to show why I implemented
the seal with support for preventing future mappings, since the writable
mappings that get created can become executable in the future, as
described later in the commit text.

I didn't consider private mappings since it wasn't clear as to how
they could be a threat to another process. A process can copy the
contents of the buffer into another executable region of memory
and just run it from there? Or are you saying that because it
can do that, is there any value in differentiating between
shared and private mappings?

Thanks,
Isaac
