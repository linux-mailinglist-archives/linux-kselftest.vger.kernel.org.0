Hello all,

I've included the masks which the CRIU developers have specified. 
max_out_page is another new optional variable which is needed to 
terminate the operation without visiting all the pages after finding the 
max_out_page number of desired pages. There is no way to terminate the 
operation without this variable.

How does the interface looks now? Please comment.
