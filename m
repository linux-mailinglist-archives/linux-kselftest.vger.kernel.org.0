> FAQs
> ====
> Q: What happens if a process is "surprised" by a user interrupt?
> A: For tasks that haven't registered with the kernel and requested for user
> interrupts aren't expected or able to receive to user interrupts.
>
> Q: Do user interrupts affect kernel scheduling?
> A: No. If a task is blocked waiting for user interrupts, when the kernel
> receives a notification on behalf of that task we only put it back on the
> runqueue. Delivery of a user interrupt in no way changes the scheduling
> priorities of a task.
>
> Q: Does the sender get to know if the interrupt was delivered?
> A: No. User interrupts only provides a posted interrupt delivery mechanism. If
> applications need to rely on whether the interrupt was delivered they should
> consider a userspace mechanism for feedback (like a shared memory counter or a
> user interrupt back to the sender).
>
> Q: Why is there no feedback on interrupt delivery?
> A: Being a posted interrupt delivery mechanism, the interrupt delivery
> happens in 2 steps:
> 1) The interrupt information is stored in a memory location (UPID).
> 2) The physical interrupt is delivered to the interrupt receiver.
>
> The 2nd step could happen immediately, after an extended period, or it might
> never happen based on the state of the receiver after step 1. (The receiver
> could have disabled interrupts, have been context switched out or it might have
> crashed during that time.) This makes it very hard for the hardware to reliably
> provide feedback upon execution of SENDUIPI.
>
> Q: Can user interrupts be nested?
> A: Yes. Using STUI instruction in the interrupt handler would allow new user
> interrupts to be delivered. However, there no TPR(thread priority register)
> like mechanism to allow only higher priority interrupts. Any user interrupt can
> be taken when nesting is enabled.
>
> Q: Can a task receive all pending user interrupts in one go?
> A: No. The hardware allows only one vector to be processed at a time. If a task
> is interested in knowing all the interrupts that are pending then we could add
> a syscall that provides the pending interrupts information.
>
> Q: Do the processes need to be pinned to a cpu?
> A: No. User interrupts will be routed correctly to whichever cpu the receiver
> is running on. The kernel updates the cpu information in the UPID during
> context switch.
>
> Q: Why are UPID and UITT allocated by the kernel?
> A: If allocated by user space, applications could misuse the UPID and UITT to
> write to unauthorized memory and generate interrupts on any cpu. The UPID and
> UITT are allocated by the kernel and accessed by the hardware with supervisor

Hi All,
My apologies if this email was sent twice.
I was not sure if my previous email followed the proper reply instruction.
I resent this email using the first reply method (Saving the mbox file, 
importing it into my mail client, and using reply-to-all from there).
The following is our understanding of the proposed User Interrupt.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have been exploring how user-level interrupts (UIs) can be used to
improve performance and programmability in several different areas:
e.g., parallel programming, memory management, I/O, and floating-point
libraries.  Before we venture into the discussion here, we want to
make sure we understand the proposed model. We describe our
understanding below in four sections:

1. Current target use cases
2. Preparing for future use cases
3. Basic Understanding
4. Multi-threaded parallel programming example

If people on this thread could either confirm or point out our
misunderstandings, we would appreciate it.

# Current Use Cases

The Current RFC is focused on sending an interrupt from one user-space
thread (UST) to another user-space thread (UST2UST).  These threads
could be in different processes, as long as the sender has access to
the receiver's User Interrupt File Descriptor (uifd).  Based on our
understanding, UIs are currently targeted as a low overhead
alternative for the current IPC mechanisms.

# Preparing for future use cases

Based on the RFC, we are aware that allowing a device and the kernel
to send a UI is still in development.  Both these cases would support
imprecise interrupts.  We can see a clear use case for the Device to
user-space thread (D2UST) UI, for example, supporting a fast way for a
GPU to inform a thread that it has finished executing a particular
kernel. If someone could point out an example for Kernel to
user-space thread (K2UST) UI, we would appreciate it.

In our work, we have also been exploring precise UIs from the
currently running thread.  We call these CPU to UST (CPU2UST) UIs.
For example, a SIGSEGV generated by writing to a read-only page, a
SIGFPE generated by dividing a number by zero.

- QUESTION: Is there is a rough draft/plan that we can refer to that 
describes the
current thinking on these three cases.

- QUESTION: Are there use cases for K2UST, or is K2UST the same as CPU2UST?

# Basic Understanding

First, we would like to make sure that our understanding of the 
terminology and the data structures is correct.

- User Interrupt Vector (UIV): The identity of the user interrupt.
- User Interrupt Target Table (UITT):
   This allows the sender to locate the "address" of the receiver 
through the uifd.
- ui_frame: Argument passed to the UI handler. It contains a stack 
pointer, saved flags, and an instruction pointer.
- Sender: The thread that issues the `_senduipi`.
- Receiver: The thread that receives the UI from the sender.

Below outlines our understanding of the current API for UIs.

- Each thread that can receive UIs has exactly one handler
   registered with `uintr_register_handler` (a syscall).
- Each thread that registers a handler calls `uintr_create_fd` for
   every user-level interrupt vector (UIV) that they expect to receive.
- The only information delivered to the handler is the UIV.
- There are 64 UIVs that can be used per thread.
- A thread that wants to send a UI must register the receiver's uifd 
with `uintr_register_sender`  (a syscall).
   This returns an index the sender uses to locate the receiver.
- `_senduipi(index)` sends a user interrupt to a particular destination.
   The sender's UITT and index determine the destination.
- A thread uses `_stui` (and `_clui`) to enable (and disable) the 
reception of UIs.
- As for now, there is no mechanism to mask a particular UIV.
- A UI is delivered to the receiver immediately only if it is currently 
running.
- If a thread executes the `uintr_wait()`, it will be scheduled only 
after receiving a UI.
   There is no guarantee on the delay between the processor receiving 
the UI and when the thread is scheduled.
- If a thread is the target of a UI and another thread is running, or 
the target thread is blocked in the kernel,
   then the target thread will handle the UI when it is next scheduled.
- Ordinary interrupts (interrupt delivered with CPL=0) have a higher 
priority over user interrupts.
- UI handler only saves general-purpose registers (e.g., do not save 
floating-point registers).
- User Interrupts with higher UIV are given a higher priority than those 
with smaller UIV.

## Private UITT

The Current RFC focuses on a private UITT where each thread has its own
UITT.  Thus, different threads executing `_senduipi(index1)` with the
same `index1` may cause different receiver threads to be interrupted.

In many cases, the receiver of an interrupt needs to know which thread
sent the interrupt. If we understand the proposal correctly, there are
only 64 user-level interrupt vectors (UIVs), and the UIV is the only
information transmitted to the receiver. The UIV itself allows the
receiver to distinguish different senders through careful management
of the receiver's UIV.

- QUESTION: Given the code below where the same UIV is registered twice:
```c
   uintr_fd1 = uintr_create_fd(vector1, flags)
   uintr_fd2 = uintr_create_fd(vector1, flags)
```
Would `uintr_fd1` be the same as `uintr_fd2`, or would it be registered 
with a different index in the UITT table?

- QUESTION: If it is registered in a different index, would the
   receiver be able to distinguish the sender if `uintr_fd1` and
   `uintr_fd2` are used from two different threads?

- QUESTION: What is the intended future use of the `flags` argument?

## Shared UITT

In the case of the shared UITT model, all the threads share the same
UITT and thus, if two different threads execute `_senduipi(index)`
with the same index, they would both cause an interrupt in the
same destination/receiver.

- QUESTION: Since both threads use the same entry (same
   destination/receiver), does this mean that the receiver will not be
   able to distinguish the sender of the interrupt?

# Multi-threaded parallel programming example

One of the uses for UIs that we have been exploring is combining the
message-passing and shared memory models for parallel programming.  In
our approach, message-passing is used for synchronization and shared
memory for data sharing.  The message passing part of the programming
pattern is based loosely on Active Messages (See ISCA92), where a
particular thread can turn off/on interrupts to ignore incoming
messages so they can execute critical sections without having to
notify any other threads in the system.

- QUESTION: Is there any data on the performance impact of `_stui` and 
`_clui`?

Thank you.
Best regards,
Chrisma
