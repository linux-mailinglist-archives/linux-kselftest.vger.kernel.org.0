IIRC, tmpfs/MAP_ANON|MAP_SHARED memory
a) Is movable, can land in ZONE_MOVABLE/CMA
b) Can be limited by sizing tmpfs appropriately

AFAIK, what you describe is a problem with memory overcommit, not with 
zone imbalances (below). Or what am I missing?

I see the following thing worth documenting:

Assume you have a system with 2GB of ZONE_NORMAL/ZONE_DMA and 4GB of 
ZONE_MOVABLE/CMA.

Assume you make use of 1.5GB of secretmem. Your system might run into 
OOM any time although you still have plenty of memory on ZONE_MOVAVLE 
(and even swap!), simply because you are making excessive use of 
unmovable allocations (for user space!) in an environment where you 
should not make excessive use of unmovable allocations (e.g., where 
should page tables go?).

The existing controls (mlock limit) don't really match the current 
semantics of that memory. I repeat it once again: secretmem *currently* 
resembles long-term pinned memory, not mlocked memory. Things will 
change when implementing migration support for secretmem pages. Until 
then, the semantics are different and this should be spelled out.

For long-term pinnings this is kind of obvious, still we're now 
documenting it because it's dangerous to not be aware of. Secretmem 
behaves exactly the same and I think this is worth spelling out: 
secretmem has the potential of being used much more often than fairly 
special vfio/rdma/ ...

Looking at a cover letter that doesn't even mention the issue of 
unmovable allocations makes me thing that we are either trying to ignore 
the problem or are not aware of the problem.
