Can you please share more details on this? It would really help improve 
the API design.

That's correct.

The idea here is improve the kernel-to-user event notification latency. 
Theoretically, this can be useful when the kernel sees event completion 
on one cpu but it want to signal (notify) a thread actively running on 
some other CPU. The receiver thread can save some cycles by avoiding 
ring transitions to receive the event.

IO_URING is one of the examples for kernel-to-user event notifications. 
We are evaluating whether providing a UINTR based completion mechanism 
can have benefit over eventfd based completions. The benefits in 
practice are yet to be measured and proven.

It is definitely possible in future to delivery CPU events as User 
Interrupts. The hardware architecture for this is still being worked on 
internally.

Though our focus isn't on exceptions being delivered as User Interrupts. 
Do you have details on what type of benefit is expected?

No, K2UST isn't the same as CPU2UST. We would expect limited benefits 
from K2UST but on the other hand CPU2UST can provide significant speedup 
since it avoids the kernel completely.

Unfortunately, due to the large scope of the feature, the hardware 
architecture development is happening in stages. I don't have detailed 
plans for each of the sources of User Interrupts.

Here is our rough plan:

1. Provide a common infrastructure to receive User Interrupts. This is 
independent of the source of the interrupt. The intention here is to 
keep the software APIs generic and extendable so that future sources can 
be added without causing much disturbance to the older APIs.

2. Introduce various sources of User Interrupts in stages:

UST2UST - This RFC. Available in the upcoming Sapphire Rapids processor.

K2UST - Also available in upcoming Sapphire Rapids. Working towards 
proving the value before sending something out.

D2UST - Future processor. Hardware architecture being worked on 
internally. Not much to share right now.

CPU2UST - Future processor. Hardware architecture being worked on 
internally. Not much to share right now.

The overall description you have mentioned below looks good to me. I 
have added some minor comments for clarification.

Also, the abbreviations that you have used are somewhat different from 
the ones I have used in the patches.

The UITT refers to the 'UPID' address which is different from the uifd 
that you mention below.

All of the statements below seem accurate.

However, some of the restrictions below are due to hardware design and 
some are mainly due to the software implementation. The software design 
and APIs might change significantly as this patch series evolves.

Please feel free to provide input wherever you think the APIs can be 
improved.

Though only one generic handler is registered with the hardware, an 
application can choose to implement 64 unique sub-handlers in user space 
based on each unique UIV.

The saving and restoring of the registers is done by gcc when the muintr 
flag along with the 'interrupt' attribute is used. Applications can 
choose to save floating point registers as part of the interrupt handler 
as well.

To make it easier for applications we are working on implementing a thin 
library that can help with some of this common functionality like saving 
floating point registers or redirecting to 64 sub-handlers.

That's right.

That's correct. User Interrupts mainly provide a door bell mechanism 
with the actual data expected to be shared through some existing mechanism.

If multiple senders want to share the same interrupt vector then they 
would have to rely on some sort of shared memory (or similar) mechanism 
to relay the relevant information to the receiver. This would likely 
come with some latency cost.

In the current design, if the same thread tries to register the same 
vector again the second uintr_create_fd() would fail with a EBUSY error 
code.

In the uintr_create_fd() call, flags would be used to provide options 
such as O_CLOEXEC. In general, I added flags argument to all the system 
calls to keep them extendable when new boolean options need to be added.

Yes. However this is true even in case of a private UITT. This isn't 
because the senders used the same UITT index rather it is the result of 
the senders generating the same UIVs.

For example, even if a receiver created 2 FDs with 2 unique vectors.

	uintr_fd1 = uintr_create_fd(vector1, flags)
	uintr_fd2 = uintr_create_fd(vector2, flags)

In case of the a private UITT, both sender threads can register 
themselves with uintr_fd1. They might get different uitt indexes 
returned to them. But when they generate a User interrupt using their 
respective index, the end result would be the same. The receiver will 
see the same vector1 being generated. There is no way for the receiver 
to distinguish the sender without some additional information being 
shared somewhere.

This look like a good fit for the User IPI (UST2UST) implementation in 
this RFC. Have you had a chance to evaluate the current API design for 
this usage?

Also, is any of the above work publicly available?

_stui and _clui are expected to have very minimal overhead since they 
only modify a local flag. I'll try to measure this next time I am doing 
some performance measurement.
