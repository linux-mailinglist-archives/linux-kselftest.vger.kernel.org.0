Yes.

Yes, I assume you implicitly assume mlock rlimit here. Also memcg
accounting should be in place. Wrt to the specific syscall, please
document why existing interfaces are not a good fit as well. It would be
also great to describe interaction with mlock itself (I assume the two
to be incompatible - mlock will fail on and mlockall will ignore it).

Yes that is something that will be needed long term. I do not think this
is strictly necessary for the initial submission, though. The
implementation should be as simple as possible now and complexity added
on top.
