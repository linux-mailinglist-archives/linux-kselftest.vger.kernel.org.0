Oops, missed the discussion.
IMHO shared rings are more elegant here. With that the app -> kernel
buffer return path doesn't need to setsockopt(), which will have to
figure out how to return buffers to pp efficiently, and then potentially
some sync on the pp allocation side. It just grabs entries from the ring
in the napi context on allocation when necessary.
But then you basically get the io_uring zc rx... just saying

They don't preclude each other, but I wouldn't say they're orthogonal.
Similar approaches, some different details. FWIW, we'll be posting a
next iteration on top of the pp providers patches soon.

Well, not exactly support of devmem, but true, we definitely want
to have io_uring zerocopy, considering all the api differences.
(at the same time not duplicating net bits).

It should, in theory, but the api wouldn't suit io_uring, internals
wouldn't be properly optimised, and we can't use it with some
important features like multishot recv because of cmsg.
