Based on what you said below, I think the kunit_find_symbol() may have
value for writing tests; however, I do not think it is the right way to
handle resources needed by test.c. I think exporting the symbols in this
case is the lesser of the two evils.

I am still suprised that you need to export a symbol that is getting
compiled into and is only used by the kunit module. In fact, I think I
found an example in the kernel where someone else managed this. Checkout
stp_policy_node_priv(). Looks like the symbol is used here[1] and is
defined here[2]. You can see here[3] and here[4] that the files end up
in the same module. Do you mind taking a look why it works for stm, but
not here?

Nifty! That sounds great!

Can you elaborate on "need[ing] to use an alternative name"?

I've got mixed feelings on this. On one hand, that has the potential to
solve a lot of problems with visibility and modules in a way that
doesn't immediately cause code under test to change in undesirable ways.
On the other hand, I feel that this has the potential to be really prone
to breakage. It would be much nicer if the compiler could tell you that
your symbol changed rather than having to wait until you run the test.
Just having the test tell you that a symbol doesn't exist anymore would
be mildly annoying, but having the signature of the symbol change could
get downright frustrating using this method.

Cool. Looks like we are on the same page then :-)

I would say it depends. I think it is fine to ask people to write code
in such a manner that makes it more testable. From my experience, this
generally leads to better quality code.

Nevertheless, I agree from the perspective that suddenly having to
export symbol names for no good reason is not something we should make
users do.

I think that makes sense.

So, I don't think the symbol lookup is needed for this patchset. I think
all the symbols that you use should *probably* be exported at worse
since they are used by the core kunit library stuff.

Nevertheless, I have a test coming down the pipeline for which this
could be a potential solution. I will CC you on the test when I send it.
