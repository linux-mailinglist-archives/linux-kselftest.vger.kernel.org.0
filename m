Thanks for the review and sorry for the late reply!

Interesting. A single writable PTE would indicate that at least some 
part of the range is exclusive (!shared) without looking at mapcounts. 
But of course, it's an unreliable check.

Yes, just like most tests, covering all corner cases takes a lot of 
effort and is probably not worth it. Wiring up io_uring (also used in 
the file already for these purposes) would be possible, however the 
initial tests are really more targeted at "bail out early" and to catch 
the obvious things one might miss when collapsing THP.

IOW: when people ignore exclusivity information when collapsing; the 
failing tests would directly tell you what needs to be done: better not 
mess with case #3. So IMHO, the basic tests for #3 are sufficient to 
express "see, you did it wrong: better be careful".

There are scenarios where we could handle #3: for example, if we're the 
only one mapping all sub-pages of a THP and there are no other 
references (i.e., page_count() == 512), we could collapse and mark the 
head page exclusive (clearing the marker from any tail pages). Once we 
really want to optimize these cases, we can add more such tests.
