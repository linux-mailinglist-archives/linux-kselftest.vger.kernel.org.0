Wouldn't it be duplication of condition if buffer is full inside
pagemap_scan_output() and just outside it. Inside pagemap_scan_output() we
check if we have space before putting data inside it. I'm using this same
condition to indicate that buffer is full.

I'm sorry. But it would bring up something new and iterations will be
needed to just play around. I like the UFFD way.
