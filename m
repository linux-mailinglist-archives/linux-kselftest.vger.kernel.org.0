The plural is misleading: it only installs a single pte, so I'm going
to ask you to change it throughout to mcopy_atomic_install_pte()
(I'm not thrilled with the "mcopy" nor the "atomic", but there you are
being consistent with userfaultfd's peculiar naming, so let them be).

(Actually that turns out to be a nice deletion of lines,
but you're absolutely right to do it as a separate patch.)

Right, I'm thinking in terms of five cases below (I'm not for a moment
saying that you need to list these out in the comment, just saying that
I could not get my head around the issues in this function without
listing them out for myself):

1. anon private mcopy (using anon page newly allocated)
2. shmem private mcopy (using anon page newly allocated)
3. shmem private mcontinue (using page in cache from shmem_getpage)
4. shmem shared mcontinue (using page in cache from shmem_getpage)
5. shmem shared mcopy (using page in cache newly allocated)

Of which each has a VM_WRITE and a !VM_WRITE case; and the third and
fourth cases are new in this patch (it really would have been better
to introduce mcopy_atomic_install_pte() in a separate earlier patch,
but don't change that now we've got this far); and the fifth case does
*not* use mcopy_atomic_install_pte() in this patch, but will in future.

And while making these notes, let's hightlight again what is commented
elsewhere, the odd nature of the second case: where userfaultfd short
circuits to an anonymous CoW page without instantiating the shmem page.
(Please double-check me on that: quite a lot of my comments below are
about this case 2, so if I've got it wrong, then I've got a lot wrong.)

Sorry, it's silly of me, but I keep getting irritated by "int writable"
in company with the various bools; and the way vm_shared is initialized
below, but writable initialized later.  Please humour me by making it
	bool writable = dst_vma->vm_flags & VM_WRITE;

> +	bool vm_shared = dst_vma->vm_flags & VM_SHARED;

And I've found that we also need
	bool page_in_cache = page->mapping;
because an anonymous page does not at this point have page->mapping
set, and does not yet satisfy PageAnon(page).  Or other naming if you
think of better; or its inverse with page_is_anon or whatever.

That appears to differ slightly from what was done before this patch:
it is now making a case 2 VM_WRITE pte unwritable, incurring an
unnecessary write fault later on.  I think it would be better
(for all fives cases) to say:

	if (page_in_cache && !vm_shared)
		writable = false;

> +
> +	if (writable || vma_is_anonymous(dst_vma))
> +		_dst_pte = pte_mkdirty(_dst_pte);

And, unlike before, that is not marking the case 2 unwritable pte dirty.
Which works okay, because add_to_swap()'s unconditional set_page_dirty()
will make sure this page is written to swap before it is freed.  But I'd
rather not rely on that here: it's a detail which might get changed one
day, and whoever changes it may not think to update mm/userfaultfd.c.

Sticking with Andrea's caution about marking a shared unwritable dirty,
but happy as before to mark a private unwritable dirty:

	if (writable || !page_in_cache)
		_dst_pte = pte_mkdirty(_dst_pte);

This does *not* mark the new cases 3 and 4 dirty when unwritable,
but there's no chance of data loss in their case, because the kernel
has not modified the page's data: the page from shmem_getpage()
is already marked correctly (usually PageDirty, but there's a
mapped-hole case where it might not be, and that is still correct).

(Why do we mark these pages dirty when writable? To skip a hardware
fault when and if the page is written later; but I'm not sure whether
that's necessarily a good idea - we don't know here whether it was a
write fault which triggered all this. I also don't know what difference
wp_copy, which skips the mkwrite, makes to this calculus; but follow
the example of before.)

Fine.

          else if (vm_shared) {

But delete this block, as we all wanted. As I've argued above,
the new cases 3 and 4 using shmem_getpage() do not need an extra
set_page_dirty() here, and we can address case 5 when it's added.

Hard to spot, but that's wrong: because mm_counter() depends on PageAnon
to decide which count to adjust, and that does not get set until the
page_add_new_anon_rmap(). I'd expect your tests to have left "Bad rss"
warnings in the kernel log? This would be why. Just move the line down
until after page_add_new_anon_rmap() - with a comment line to say why!

> +	if (vma_is_shmem(dst_vma))

No, that gets case 2 wrong: use "if (page_in_cache)" instead.

Right, I'll go along with that. I did say to use SGP_CACHE, and I'm not
sure why you did not, but perhaps were put off it by my remarks about a
racing hole punch. Using SGP_READ here, you will not allocate an
unnecessary page in that (exceptional) case, good; but you are left with
inconsistent behaviour on fallocated (!PageUptodate: the page has been
allocated, but not yet cleared or overwritten with user data) pages.

No bad data is leaked, but the inconsistency is that handle_userfault()
believes there's a page at this offset, but mcontinue_atomic_pte() says
there is not (and might they retry forever disagreeing?). It's a somewhat
grey area: I'd say your mcontinue_atomic_pte() is the correct one (it is
a hole, but one that we happen to have reserved future space for); but
that we don't really want to complicate the other end for it (if we skip
going the VM_UFFD_MINOR way, it's more of a problem for VM_UFFD_MISSING).

I think stick with SGP_READ as you have: just be aware at the userspace
end that this case might occur (and you only have to fault the page into
the other mapping to resolve it), if anyone is using fallocate().

All the rest of 4/9 looked fine to me, though I have worried about a
couple more things.

One: whereas I tend to think of one call to handle_userfault() ending
up in one call to mcopy_atomic_install_pte() to resolve it, I see that
actually __mcopy_atomic() can be a loop over many pages, and I have
not thought through all the possibilities that might allow, and now
with the interspersal of MINOR and MISSING.

Two: mcopy_atomic_install_pte() can only install a pte, and it looks
as if it handles tails of a compound page correctly (as might come
from a MINOR userfault on a pre-existing shmem THP); but there is no
mapping of huge page by pmd, and khugepaged's userfaultfd_armed()
checks will (rightly) keep it from interfering. I guess later on,
after all the userfaultfd-ing is done, khugepaged can come around
and collapse to huge pages, if the file was on a huge mount: okay.
