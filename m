Adding to that, I'll give up arguing now as I have more important things 
to do. It has been questioned by various people why we need a dedicate 
syscall and at least for me, without a satisfying answer.

Worst thing is that we end up with a syscall that could have been 
avoided, for example, because
1. We add existing/future memfd_create() flags to memfd_secret() as well 
when we need them (sealing, hugetlb., ..).
2. We decide in the future to still add MFD_SECRET support to 
memfd_secret().

So be it.
