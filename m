Fine by me.  I will add it the next iterations.

As far as I understand the data segment "lives" below the program break, hence
it is a way of describing the range from which the user can obtain a valid
tagged pointer.

Said that, I am not really sure on how do you want me to document this (my aim
is for this to be clear to the userspace developers). Could you please propose
something?
