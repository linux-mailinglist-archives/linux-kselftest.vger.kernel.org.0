We can add as much flexibility as much people ask by keeping code simple.
But it is going to be dirty to add error check which detects if return_mask
= 0 and if there is only 1 flag of interest mentioned by the user. The
following mentioned error check is essential to return deterministic
output. Do you think this case is worth it to support and we don't want to
go with the generality for both 1 or more flag cases?

if (return_mask == 0 && hweight_long(required_mask | any_mask) != 1)
	return error;

You want PAGE_IS_FILE to be zero and at the same time you are requiring the
PAGE_IS_FILE. It is confusing. Lets go with excluded mask and excluded_mask
must never have any bit matching with required_mask. Lets stay with this as
it is intuitive and would be easy to use from the user's perspective.
Andrei and Danylo had suggested these mask scheme and have use cases for
this. Andrei and Danylo can please comment as well.
