It's close to XPFO in the sense it removes pages from the kernel page
table. But unlike XPFO memfd_secret() does not mean allowing access to
these pages in the kernel until they are freed by the user. And, unlike
XPFO, it does not require TLB flushing all over the place.

The uncached mappings were originally proposed as a mean "... to prevent
or considerably restrict speculation on such pages" [1] as a comment to
my initial proposal to use mmap(MAP_EXCLUSIVE).

I've added the ability to create uncached mappings into the fd-based
implementation of the exclusive mappings as it is indeed can reduce
availability of side channels and the implementation was quite straight
forward.
