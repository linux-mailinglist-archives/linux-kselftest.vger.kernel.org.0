OK but here we're neither using it nor even checking its success.

I think I didn't explain myself well. I'm not contesting a writable /tmp,
I was asking why *tmpfs*, because we have a root on ramfs by default, so
when you create /tmp, the sole fact that it succeeds implies that whatever
you'll put into it will already work without having to remount a tmpfs
inside.

OK, then I'll do that.

That's not what I'm seeing on most of the systems I'm having access to,
where /tmp is on a plain file system (either / or link to /var/tmp but
always on disk, likely due to the huge size of the stuff stored there
that is rarely used and that should not eat memory).

Indeed, and also, please keep in mind what the purpose of nolibc-test is:
make sure that the syscalls wrappers we write do work as expected, in part
by allowing us to compare against another libc to figure whether it's
the libc, the test or the kernel that causes any difference. The rest is
purely out of scope. Thus it's not this test's business to verify that a
tmpfs is indeed present after trying to mount it under /tmp, however it's
this test business to make sure that options passed to mount() do work as
expected, and that when a writable area is needed for a test, a working
one is assigned. Thus for the specific case you mention, we don't care.
And I'd go further, there can and should be reasonable prerequisites to
run this test.

No worries, I've modified it accordingly with the following commit message,
just let me know if you want to change anything:

  commit 11fddb386bd663a554cc08c5950d9da2c87a7267 (HEAD)
  Author: Zhangjin Wu <falcon@tinylab.org>
  Date:   Sat Jul 8 02:38:57 2023 +0800

    selftests/nolibc: prepare /tmp for tests that need to write
    
    create a /tmp directory. If it succeeds, the directory is writable,
    which is normally the case when booted from an initramfs anyway.
    
    This will be used instead of procfs for some tests.
