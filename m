Right you are.  My mind did not span from patch 1 to patch 2. Apologies for
the noise.

Thanks for the extra reassurance.

Please do.  And no need to credit me.

I wasn't really sure what to label it as.  My inspiration was based
a little bit on reading through the Linux 5.5 KUnit source and
documentation, and trying to understand the expectations of the
KUnit framework and what the test cases have to either obey or
can expect.

I think there is a lot of history that you know, but is only visible
to test implementors if they read through the past couple of years
email threads.
