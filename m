Jumping in with a pure device driver hat: We already have add-hoc unit
tests in drivers/gpu, which somewhat shoddily integrate into
kselftests and our own gpu test suite from userspace. We'd like to do
a lot more in this area (there's enormous amounts of code in a gpu
driver that's worth testing on its own, or against a mocked model of a
part of the real hw), and I think a unit test framework for the entire
kernel would be great. Plus gpu/drm isn't the only subsystem by far
that already has a home-grown solution. So it's actually worse than
what Ted said: We don't just have a multitude of test frameworks
already, we have a multitude of ad-hoc unit test frameworks, each with
their own way to run tests, write tests and mock parts of the system.
Kunit hopefully helps us to standardize more in this area. I do plan
to look into converting all the drm selftest we have already as soon
as this lands (and as soon as I find some time ...).
