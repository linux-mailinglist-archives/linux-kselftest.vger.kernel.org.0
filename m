I always forget, migration means different things to different audiences.
As an mm person, I was meaning page migration, whereas a virtualization
person thinks VM live migration (which that reference appears to be about),
a scheduler person task migration, an ornithologist bird migration, etc.

But you're an mm person too: you may have cited that reference in the
knowledge that TDX 1.5 Live Migration will entail page migration of the
kind I'm thinking of.  (Anyway, it's not important to clarify that here.)

Last year's MFD_HUGEPAGE proposal would have allowed you to do it with
memfd via tmpfs without needing to involve hugetlbfs; but you may prefer
the determinism of hugetlbfs, relying on /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages etc.

But I've yet to see why you want to involve this or that filesystem
(with all its filesystem-icity suppressed) at all.  The backing store
is host memory, and tmpfs and hugetlbfs just impose their own
idiosyncrasies on how that memory is allocated; but I think you would
do better to choose your own idiosyncrasies in allocation directly -
you don't need a different "backing store" to choose between 4k or 2M
or 1G or whatever allocations.

tmpfs and hugetlbfs and page cache are designed around sharing memory:
TDX is designed around absolutely not sharing memory; and the further
uses which Sean foresees appear not to need it as page cache either.

Except perhaps for page migration reasons.  It's somewhat incidental,  
but of course page migration knows how to migrate page cache, so
masquerading as page cache will give a short cut to page migration,
when page migration becomes at all possible.

You are already proposing a new set of rules, foreign to how tmpfs works
for others.  You're right that KVM allocating large amounts of memory,
opaque to core-mm, carries risk: and you'd be right to say that shmem.c
provides some clues (security_vm_enough_memory checks, memcg charging,
user_shm_lock accounting) on what to remember.

But I'm not up to the job of being the one to police you there,
and you don't want to be waiting on me either.

To take a rather silly example: Ted just added chattr support to tmpfs,
and it fits in well.  But I don't now want to have to decide whether
"chattr +i" FS_IMMUTABLE_FL is or is not compatible with
MEMFILE_F_USER_INACCESSIBLE.  They are from different worlds,
and I'd prefer KVM to carry the weight of imposing INACCESSIBLE:
which seems easily done if it manages the fd, without making the
memory allocated to that fd accessible to those who hold the fd.

Yes, I suspected that machines running TDX guests might well consume
most of the memory that way, but glad(?) to hear it confirmed.

I am not suggesting that this memory be treated as a fringe case, rather
the reverse: a different case, not something to hide away inside shmem.c.

Is there a notion that /proc/meminfo "Shmem:" is going to be a good hint
of this usage?  Whether or not it's also included in "Shmem:", I expect
that its different characteristics will deserve its own display.
