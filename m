Hmm. I don't understand you.

I agree we have a problem which should be fixed. Just the changelog
looks confusing to me, imo it doesn't explain the race/problem clearly.

OK, thanks, I was wrong. I forgot about "A task may only write its own attributes".
So yes, ptrace_attach() is the only source of problematic mutex_lock() today.
There were more in the past.

I don't follow...

I didn't say that t is a group leader. I said it can be a zombie sub-thread
with ->exit_state != 0.

That is what I said before. Debugger should release a zombie sub-thread,
it won't do __exit_signal() on its own.

To me this adds the unnecessary complication.

But the unsafe_execve_in_progress logic increases the impact and complicates
the patch.

I think the fix should be as simple as possible. (to be honest, right now
I don't think this is a right approach).

Not sure I understand, but you can add the performance improvements later.
Not to mention that this should be justified, and the for_other_threads()
loop added by this patch into de_thread() is not nice performance-wise.

Oleg.
