The soft-dirtiness is stored in the PTE. VMA is marked dirty to store the
dirtiness for reused regions. Clearing the soft-dirty status of whole
process is straight forward. When we want to clear/monitor the
soft-dirtiness of a part of the virtual memory, there is a lot of internal
noise. We don't want the non-dirty pages to become dirty because of how the
soft-dirty feature has been working. Soft-dirty feature wasn't being used
the way we want to use now. While monitoring a part of memory, it is not
acceptable to get non-dirty pages as dirty. Non-dirty pages become dirty
when the two VMAs are merged without considering if they both are dirty or
not (34228d473efe). To monitor changes over the memory, sometimes VMAs are
split to clear the soft-dirty bit in the VMA flags. But sometimes kernel
decide to merge them backup. It is so waste of resources.

To keep things consistent, the default behavior of the IOCTL is to output
even the extra non-dirty pages as dirty from the kernel noise. A optional
PAGEMAP_NO_REUSED_REGIONS flag is added for those use cases which aren't
tolerant of extra non-dirty pages. This flag can be considered as something
which is by-passing the already present buggy implementation in the kernel.
It is not buggy per say as the issue can be solved if we don't allow the
two VMA which have different soft-dirty bits to get merged. But we are
allowing that so that the total number of VMAs doesn't increase. This was
acceptable at the time, but now with the use case of monitoring a part of
memory for soft-dirty doesn't want this merging. So either we need to
revert 34228d473efe and PAGEMAP_NO_REUSED_REGIONS flag will not be needed
or we should allow PAGEMAP_NO_REUSED_REGIONS or similar mechanism to ignore
the extra dirty pages which aren't dirty in reality.

When PAGEMAP_NO_REUSED_REGIONS flag is used, only the PTEs are checked to
find if the pages are dirty. So re-used regions cannot be detected. This
has the only side-effect of not checking the VMAs. So this is limitation of
using this flag which should be acceptable in the current state of code.
This limitation is okay for the users as they can clear the soft-dirty bit
of the VMA before starting to monitor a range of memory for soft-dirtiness.

Sorry, I'm unable to completely grasp the meaning of the example. We have
followed clear_refs_write() to write the soft-dirty bit clearing code in
the current patch. Dirtiness of the VMA and the PTE may be set
independently. Newer allocated memory has dirty bit set in the VMA. When
something is written the memory, the soft dirty bit is set in the PTEs as
well regardless if the soft dirty bit is set in the VMA or not.

non-dirty pages as dirty. Can there be some alternative to adding this
flag? Please suggest.
