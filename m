Looks test_sysfs isn't in linus tree, where can I find it? Also please
update your commit log about this wrong info if it can't be applied on
zram.

Can you share the code which waits for the sysfs / kernfs files to be
stop being used? And why does it make a difference in case of being
called from module_exit()?
