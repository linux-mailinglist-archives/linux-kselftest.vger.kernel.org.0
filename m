I did, in an attempt to make it "even more clear" :) Sorry about that, 
glad you got the intention.

There are indeed, but not in the part this series depends on, as far as 
I can see.

I'm happy to do whatever I can to make the review easier.  I suppose the 
extreme case is to wait for the dependencies to get accepted, 
effectively serialising submissions, but that slows the process down 
significantly.  For example, I received very good feedback on v1 and v2 
of this series and was able to address it instead of waiting for the 
dependency.  Would including the required patches directly in the series 
help?  My only concern is in that case the same patch will be submitted 
multiple times (as a part of every depending series), but if it's 
better, I'll be doing that instead.
