Oh did that approach not even use VMA locks _at all_?

Yeah, this is a horrible situation to be in for such a trivial thing. But I

Ack well in that case :)

But still it'd be nice to somehow restrict the impact of this callback.

It might be worth adding that to commit message to underline that this has
been considered and this is the resolution.

Something like:

	we guarantee forward progress by always resolving contention via a
	fallback to an mmap-read lock.

	We shouldn't see a repeated fallback to mmap read locks in
	practice, as this require a vanishingly unlikely series of lock
	contentions (for instance due to repeated VMA split
	operations). However even if this did somehow happen, we would
	still progress.

Yeah, I know, and apologies for that, but I really oppose us having this
super delicate VMA logic in an fs/proc file, one we don't maintain for that
matter.

I know it's a total pain, but this just isn't the right place to be doing
such a careful dance.

I'm not saying relocate code that belongs here, but find a way to abstract
the operations.

Perhaps could be a walker or something that does all the state transition
stuff that you can then just call from the walker functions here?

You could then figure out something similar for the PROCMAP_QUERY logic.

We're not doing this VMA locking stuff for smaps are we? As that is walking
page tables anyway right? So nothing would change for that.

Right, of course. But I think the problem is the 'when' it refers to. It's
the sequence number associatied with the mm here sure, but when was it
snapshotted? How do we use it?

Something like 'last_seen_seqnum' or 'mm_wr_seq_start' or something plus a
comment would be helpful.

This is nitty I know... but this stuff is very confusing and I think every
little bit we do to help explain things is helpful here.

Well the read lock will always succeed if mmap read lock is held right?
Actually... no :)

I see your point below about vma_start_read_locked() :>)

I see below you suggest splitting into two functions, that seems to be a
good way forward.

I _think_ we won't even need the checks re: mm and last_pos in that case
right? As holding the mmap lock we should be able to guarantee? Or at least
the mm check?

Yeah, I'll pretend this is what I meant to sound smart :P but this is a

Yeah that'd be helpful. I think this should also simplify things?

Right sure.

But I'm just wondering why we don't do the retry stuff, e.g.:

		/* Check if the VMA got isolated after we found it */
		if (PTR_ERR(vma) == -EAGAIN) {
			count_vm_vma_lock_event(VMA_LOCK_MISS);
			/* The area was replaced with another one */
			goto retry;
		}

I mean do we need to retry under mmap lock in that case? Can we just retry
the lookup? Or is this not a worthwhile optimisation here?

You know, it's me so I might have to mention a helper struct here :P it's
the two most Lorenzo things - helper sructs and churn...

Right yeah I'm all for simplifying if we can! Sounds sensible.

Yeah, I guess I can moan to PeterZ about that :P

It's not a big deal honestly, but it was just something I found confusing.

I think adjusting the comment above to something like:

		/*
		 * Verify if the address space changed since vma lookup, or if
		 * the speculative lock needs to be retried.
		 */

Or perhaps somethig more in line with the description you give below?

Yeah I saw that, but going 2 levels deep to read a comment isn't great.

But again this isn't the end of the world.

OK so read section retry required = the seq num changes from under us
(checked carefully with memory barriers and carefully considered and
thought out such logic), and the priv->mm_wr_seq check before it is the
'was this changed even before we began?'

I wonder btw if we could put both into a single helper function to check
whether that'd be clearer.

I know it's pedantic but feels like 'err' is not a great name for this.

Maybe 'nolock' or something? Or 'lock_failed'?

Well it was more of a question really - can the traversal through
/proc/$pid/maps result in some kind of error that doesn't reach this
function, thereby leaving things locked mistakenly?

If not then happy days :)

I'm guessing there isn't.

OK and then we're fine with it because the gap we report will be an actual

I think if you refactor into two separate functions this becomes even more
unnecessary because then you are using a vma lock function that can never
fail etc.

I mean maybe just stick a VM_ in front if it's not going to happen but for
debug/dev/early stabilisation purposes we want to keep an eye on it.

Yeah, I was just wondering whether there were any odd corner case that
might be problematic.

But since we treat last_pos as inclusive as you said in a response above,
and of course vma->vm_end is exclusive, then this makes sense.

It's so gross this. I guess something about the inner workings of gate VMAs
and the use of -2UL as a weird sentinel etc.

But this is out of scope here.

Yeah sorry I was being an idiot, I misread this as >= 0 obviously.

I had assumed you were checking for the -2 and -1 cases (though -1 early
exits above).

So in that case, are you handling the gate VMA correctly here? Surely we
should exclude that? Wouldn't setting ppos = last_addr = priv->last_pos be
incorrect if this were a gate vma?

Even if we then call get_gate_vma() we've changed these values? Or is that
fine?

And yeah a comment would be good thanks!
