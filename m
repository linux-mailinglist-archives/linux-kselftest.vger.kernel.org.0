I attempted to fix it once and had to revert the patch. This relative
problem needs to be fixed and being tracked as a bug.

As I said above, there were higher priority test build and install
failures in cross-build and native build use-cases when I made this
call to prioritize fixing them first. I fixed all the known issues.

As of Linux 5.7-rc5 all of the know issues related test build and
install failures have been fixed.

With tha done, it is time to work on the relative path fix. I have
my reverted patch to start with and get it to work with the
workflows so it doesn't break them.

I also have the following patch you gave me as reference for fixing
the relative path problem:

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/158351957799.3363.15269768530697526765.stgit@devnote2/

In any case, based on my previous experience fixing this problem,
I plan to take the fix in rc1 to allow enough time to fix any
problems that show up. It will be fixed for sure.

Hope this helps addresses any concerns you may have on whether or
not this problem will be fixed.

thanks,
