MAP_FILE is actually defined as 0 usually :) But I meant file-backed private mappings.

Sorry, it was late and I gave you a crap example. Consider this:
a file-backed MAP_PRIVATE vma is marked RW. I write to it, then RO-it + mseal.

The attacker later gets me to MADV_DONTNEED that VMA. You've just lost data.

The big problem here is with anon _pages_, not anon vmas.

I just told you they use munmap under the hood. It's just that the requirement isn't actually
written down anywhere.

No, it's a matter of providing a sane API without tons of edgecases. Making a VMA immutable should make a VMA
immutable, and not require you to provide a crap ton of other mechanisms in order to truly make it immutable.
If I call mseal, I expect it to be sealed, not "sealed except when it's not, lol".

You haven't been able to quite specify what semantics are desirable out of this whole thing. Making
prot flags "immutable" is completely worthless if you can simply write to a random pseudofile and
have it bypass the whole thing (where a write to /proc/self/mem is semantically equivalent to
mprotect RW + write + mprotect RO). Making the vma immutable is completely worthless
if I can simply wipe anon pages. There has to be some end goal here (make contents immutable?
make sure VMA protection can't be changed? both?) which seems to be unclear from the kernel mmap-side.

If you insist on providing half-baked APIs (and waving off any concerns), I'm sure this would've been better
implemented as a random bpf program for chrome. Maybe we could revert this whole thing and give eBPF one
or two bits of vma flags for their own uses :)

I'm not blocking /proc/pid/mem, and my distro doesn't run any of those security modules :/
