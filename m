Yeah, it was a bad wording.

Actually no.

What I'd want to do is that the functions which call these result 
calculator functions would specify the number of tests they passed
into the result calculator. It seems safer because the results are read 
back from a file which could have changed (or got deleted due to an 
ipc bug prematurely cleaning up the file) and would better take account 
those cases where the first value is skipped when reading the results.

I think I'll drop this patch for now.
