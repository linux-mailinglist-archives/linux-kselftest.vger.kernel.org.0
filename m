I wasn't aware they depend on headers_install. Why doesn't
Documentation/dev-tools/kselftest.rst mention this in the section that
describes how to run tests?

It seems what I really need to fix the build is to include
linux/mount.h, which works for me with or without headers_install,
because I have the struct in /usr/include/linux/mount.h. And I suppose
the makefile should use KHDR_INCLUDES. So maybe the changes below should
also be included.

However I know Christian has said that there are challenges with
including the mount headers. He wrote this test, so I'd like to hear his
thoughts about adding the include. He's on vacation this week though.

Agreed that this isn't ideal.
