Subject: [PATCH v13 9/9] Documentation: update path-lookup to mention trailing magic-links
Date:   Tue,  1 Oct 2019 04:33:16 +1000

We've introduced new (somewhat subtle) behaviour regarding trailing
magic-links, so it's best to make sure everyone can follow along with
the reasoning behind trailing_magiclink().

+
+In order to avoid potential re-opening attacks (especially in the context
+of containers), it is necessary to restrict the ability for a trailing
+magic-link to be opened. The restrictions are as follows (and are
+implemented in ``trailing_magiclink()``):
+
+* If the ``open()`` is an "ordinary open" (without ``O_PATH``), the
+  access-mode of the ``open()`` call must be permitted by one of the
+  octets in the magic-link's file mode (elsewhere in Linux, ordinary
+  symlinks have a file mode of ``0777`` but this doesn't apply to
+  magic-links). Each "ordinary" file in ``/proc/self/fd/$n`` has the user
+  octet of its file mode set to correspond to the access-mode it was
+  opened with.
+
+  This restriction means that you cannot re-open an ``O_RDONLY`` file
+  descriptor through ``/proc/self/fd/$n`` with ``O_RDWR``.
+
+With a "half-open" (with ``O_PATH``), there is no ``-EACCES``-enforced
+restrictions on ``open()``, but there are rules about the mode shown in
+``/proc/self/fd/$n``:
+
+* If the target of the ``open()`` is not a magic-link, then the group
+  octet of the file mode is set to permit all access modes.
+
+* Otherwise, the mode of the new ``O_PATH`` descriptor is set to
+  effectively the same mode as the magic-link (though the permissions are
+  set in the group octet of the mode). This means that an ``O_PATH`` of a
+  magic-link gives you no more re-open permissions than the magic-link
+  itself.
+
+With these ``O_PATH`` restrictions, it is still possible to re-open an
+``O_PATH`` file descriptor but you cannot use ``O_PATH`` to work around
+the above restrictions on "ordinary opens" of magic-links.
+
+In order to avoid certain race conditions (where a file descriptor
+associated with a magic-link is swapped, causing the ``link_inode`` of
+``nameidata`` to become stale during magic-link traversal),
+``nd_jump_link()`` stores the mode of the magic-link during traversal in
+``last_magiclink``.
