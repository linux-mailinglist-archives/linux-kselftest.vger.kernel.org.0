Hi Olof/All,

I'm trying to digest all the feedback of what needs to be done.
I will be fixing up all the valuable comments about general issues but 
would like to know
what needs to be done about the tty interface.

The VK devices are configured to write serial data to circular buffers 
in memory or out a UART.
When we configure a system using the UART we connect a cable to the host 
and open a tty device.
When we don't connect a UART cable to the host we open the tty device in 
our driver instead.
In this case the memory is exposed to the host via PCI BAR memory space.
The bcm-vk host driver then accesses PCI space and presents a tty 
interface to the host.
We implemented a tty device to present the tty interface.
Host doesn't change anything other than opening a different devnode in 
UART vs. PCI case.

Based on all the comments: what interface should we be providing in 
driver instead?
