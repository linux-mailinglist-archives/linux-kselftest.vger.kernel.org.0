Below are more details about the livepatch code. I hope that it will
help you to see if zram has similar problems or not.

We have kobject in three structures: klp_func, klp_object, and
klp_patch, see include/linux/livepatch.h.

These structures have to be statically defined in the module sources
because they define what is livepatched, see
samples/livepatch/livepatch-sample.c

The kobject is used there to show information about the patch, patched
objects, and patched functions, in sysfs. And most importantly,
the sysfs interface can be used to disable the livepatch.

The problem with static structures is that the module must stay
in the memory as long as the sysfs interface exists. It can be
solved in module_exit() callback. It could wait until the sysfs
interface is destroyed.

kobject API does not support this scenario. The relase() callbacks
are called asynchronously. It expects that the structure is bundled
in a dynamically allocated structure.  As a result, the sysfs
interface can be removed even after the module removal.

The livepatching might create the dynamic structures by duplicating
the structures defined in the module statically. It might safe us
some headaches with kobject release. But it would also need an extra code
that would need to be maintained. The structure constrains strings
than need to be duplicated and later freed...

Livepatch code never called kobject_del() under a lock. It would cause
the obvious deadlock. The historic code only waited in the
module_exit() callback until the sysfs interface was removed.

It has changed in the commit 958ef1e39d24d6cb8bf2a740 ("livepatch:
Simplify API by removing registration step"). The livepatch could
never get enabled again after it was disabled now. The sysfs interface
is removed when the livepatch gets disabled. The module could
be removed only after the sysfs interface is destroyed, see
the module_put() in klp_free_patch_finish().

The livepatch code uses workqueue because the livepatch can be
disabled via sysfs interface. It obviously could not wait until
the sysfs interface is removed in the sysfs write() callback
that triggered the removal.

HTH,
