Right. But we don't want to perform GET in case of ResetWriteWatch(). It'll
be wasted effort to perform GET as well when we don't care about the dirty
status of the pages.

Yeah, this need to be fixed.

This can be the 3rd thing to fix.

Is it possible for you to fix the above mentioned 3 things and send the
patch for my testing:
1 Make GET optional
2 Detect partial THP WP operation and split
3 Optimization of moving this interesting logic to output() function

Please let me know if you cannot make the above fixes. I'll mix my patch
version and your patch and fix these things up.
