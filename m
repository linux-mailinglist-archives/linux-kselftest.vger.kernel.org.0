I don't know if we have a herd of readers. The problem statement was
for a low-priority reader (monitors) blocking a high-priority writer.
Multiple readers are of course possible, so I think as long as we can
guarantee forward progress we should be ok. Is that reasonable?

Yeah. I guess we could guarantee forward progress if the readers would
take mmap_read_lock on contention and produce one page worth of output
under that lock before dropping it and continuing with speculation
again. If contention happens again it grabs the mma_read_lock and
repeats the dance. IOW, we start with speculation, on contention we
grab the lock to produce one page and go back to speculation. Repeat
until all vmas are reported. OTOH I guess Paul's benchmark would show
some regression though... Can't have everything :)
