As you mention below I think the key distinction is the scope - I
think MADV_HWPOISON affects the whole system, including other
processes.

For our purposes, we really just want to "poison" this particular
virtual address (the HVA, from the VM's perspective), not even other
mappings of the same shared memory. I think that behavior is different
from MADV_HWPOISON, at least.

I look at it a bit differently...

Even existing UFFDIO_* operations could technically be separated from
userfaultfd. You could imagine a MADV_MAP_PAGE instead of
UFFDIO_CONTINUE. UFFDIO_COPY is a bit trickier since it takes an
argument, but it could be done with process_madvise(). (Granted, I'm
not sure this would be useful... But this is equally true for
UFFDIO_SIGBUS; it seems non-live-migration use cases could use
MADV_HWPOISON, and for live migration use cases we will be using
UFFD.)

We've sort of setup a convention with userfaultfd where at a high
level users are supposed to:

1. Receive events from the uffd
2. Resolve those events with UFFDIO_* ioctls
3. Wake up with UFFDIO_WAKE to retry the fault that generated the
original event (can be combined with step 2 of course)

So for me, even if MADV_PGERR or similar existed, I would be tempted
to add a UFFDIO_SIGBUS as well, even if it just calls the same
underlying function to do the same thing, if only for consistency
(with the idea "UFFD events are resolved by UFFD ioctls") from the
user's perspective.
