Wasn't this the case only before the intermediate p->vec_buf array was
added? It is now a kmalloc()ed temporary and it isn't copied to
userspace until the walk iteration finishes.

But why ENOSPC is not good here? I was used before, I think.

I mean that `p->max_pages`, if 0, will never compare equal to
`p->found_pages` here.

Why do we need that check? Wouldn't `is_written =3D false` work for vmas
not registered via uffd?

Oh, indeed. It seems I then misunderstood what `access_ok()` does. It
is only doing a sanity check on the pointer (range) and not actually
verifying memory mapping validity. So as a early-fail check it's ok.

I see a bit of inconsistency here in that in some parts of the API we
disallow nonsensical (no-op) parameters (like output_mask =3D=3D 0 or
required_mask =3D=3D excluded_mask), but in others do not. I'd prefer to
have it one way and if I had to choose I'd allow trivial no-ops to
reduce the kernel-side code overhead.

The other topic is whether we should limit the page selection to
PAGE_IS_WRITTEN for WP op. I don't see any benefit from that.

Maybe we should go back to the drawing board for a quick review: Can
we decouple the responsibilities of the page selection from WP
operation? I'd think yes - are there downsides to having the
required/any/excluded masks limit the pages presented to GET and/or WP
and have GET use returned_mask, max_pages, vec_buf+len and stop the
scan after the limit is hit? WP would just act on whatever pages were
accepted by the walk filter and (if enabled) GET output buffer.

Nit: I'd prefer the excluded_mask be replaced by inverted_mask, but we
already discussed that so feel free to ignore. This would remove a bit
of logic from the filtering code, and userspace could always wrap the
ioctl in a function that converts from required+excluded into
required+inverted.

While here, I wonder if we really need to fail the call if there are
unknown bits in those masks set: if this bit set is expanded with
another category flags, a newer userspace run on older kernel would
get EINVAL even if the "treat unknown as 0" be what it requires.
There is no simple way in the API to discover what bits the kernel
supports. We could allow a no-op (no WP nor GET) call to help with
that and then rejecting unknown bits would make sense.

From the implementation and our discussions I guess the
`bitmap`/`flags` field is holding a set of matching categories: a bit
value 1 =3D pages are in this category, value 0 =3D pages are not in this
category.

We are describing (in the name) only that it is a range, but not of
what or what purpose. That information is only in the docstring, but
it is harder to get by someone just reading the code.

Ok, then this intent (if I understand correctly) does not entirely
match the implementation. Let's split up the conditions:

1. The address range needs to be walked until max pages pages are found

current implementation: the address range is walked until max pages
matching masks (incl. return_mask) are reported by GET (or until end
of range if GET is not requested).
Maybe we need to describe what "found" means here?

2. user buffer is full

Matches implementation except in GET+WP edge cases.

3. or whole range is walked

Matches implementation.

4.  If the page will be added to user buffer or not depends on the
selection criteria (*masks).

Is `return_mask` a selection criterion? The implementation does skip
(counting and outputting) pages where (category_mask & return_mask) =3D=3D
0.

5. There is no difference in case of walk for GET, WP and GET+WP.

I'm not sure I understand this condition: Is it that the sequence of
pages walked does not depend on the operations? If so, then I think
the implementation matches (not entirely sure, though).

6. Only that WP doesn't take any user buffer

Matches implementation (trivial).

7. ... and just WPs the whole region.

Follows from current implementation for #1.

But there is an additional restriction:
- if using WP, masks can only contain IS_WRITTEN.

Summing this up: I think the number of interactions between various
parameters can be reduced:
a. required/anyof/excluded masks apply to the operation as a whole
(selecting pages to act on); and
b. returned_mask, max_pages, vec_buf+len apply to GET and stop the
walk early if limits are hit (checked before WP is done)

That way we can conceptually decouple WP from the selection of pages
and don't need to restrict the page masks to IS_WRITTEN. This makes
the operation basically a GET (SCAN as the ioctl name suggests) with
an auxiliary and optional WP (IOW: pages walked don't depend on WP
operation being requested or not). This also matches the current
implementation, where plain WP can be done via UFFD-specific call.
(BTW, why the UFFD one has to be slower?)

(Note: my intent in this discussion is to minimise the effort needed
to understand how to use and what are the restrictions of the API -
and doing this by minimizing the number and size of rules that one has
to apply. Nb. this is proportional to number of rules in
...args_validate().)
