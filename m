-Using KUnit
-===========
-
-The purpose of this document is to describe what KUnit is, how it works, how it
-is intended to be used, and all the concepts and terminology that are needed to
-understand it. This guide assumes a working knowledge of the Linux kernel and
-some basic knowledge of testing.

-Organization of this document
-=============================
-
-This document is organized into two main sections: Testing and Common Patterns.
-The first covers what unit tests are and how to use KUnit to write them. The
-second covers common testing patterns, e.g. how to isolate code and make it
-possible to unit test code that was otherwise un-unit-testable.

-What is KUnit?
---------------
-
-"K" is short for "kernel" so "KUnit" is the "(Linux) Kernel Unit Testing
-Framework." KUnit is intended first and foremost for writing unit tests; it is
-general enough that it can be used to write integration tests; however, this is
-a secondary goal. KUnit has no ambition of being the only testing framework for
-the kernel; for example, it does not intend to be an end-to-end testing
-framework.

-What is Unit Testing?
----------------------
-
-A `unit test <https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UnitTest.html>`_ is a test that
-tests code at the smallest possible scope, a *unit* of code. In the C
-programming language that's a function.
-
-Unit tests should be written for all the publicly exposed functions in a
-compilation unit; so that is all the functions that are exported in either a
-*class* (defined below) or all functions which are **not** static.

-the signature ``void (*)(struct kunit *test)``. It calls a function to be tested

 Expectations

-In this example, the method under test should return a pointer to a value, so

 Test Suites

-related tests most unit testing frameworks - including KUnit - provide the

 Isolating Behavior
 ------------------
 
-The most important aspect of unit testing that other forms of testing do not
-provide is the ability to limit the amount of code under test to a single unit.
-In practice, this is only possible by being able to control what code gets run

-through some sort of indirection where a function is exposed as part of an API
-such that the definition of that function can be changed without affecting the

 Classes
 ~~~~~~~
 
 Classes are not a construct that is built into the C programming language;

-that does not use a standardized object oriented library (like GNOME's GObject)
-has their own slightly different way of doing object oriented programming; the

+however, it is an easily derived concept. Accordingly, in most cases, every
+project that does not use a standardized object oriented library (like GNOME's
+GObject) has their own slightly different way of doing object oriented
+programming; the Linux kernel is no exception.
 
 The central concept in kernel object oriented programming is the class. In the
 kernel, a *class* is a struct that contains function pointers. This creates a
 contract between *implementers* and *users* since it forces them to use the
-same function signature without having to call the function directly. In order
-for it to truly be a class, the function pointers must specify that a pointer
-to the class, known as a *class handle*, be one of the parameters; this makes
-it possible for the member functions (also known as *methods*) to have access
-to member variables (more commonly known as *fields*) allowing the same
-implementation to have multiple *instances*.
-
-Typically a class can be *overridden* by *child classes* by embedding the
-*parent class* in the child class. Then when a method provided by the child
-class is called, the child implementation knows that the pointer passed to it is
-of a parent contained within the child; because of this, the child can compute
-the pointer to itself because the pointer to the parent is always a fixed offset
-from the pointer to the child; this offset is the offset of the parent contained
-in the child struct. For example:

-KUnit on non-UML architectures
-==============================
-
-By default KUnit uses UML as a way to provide dependencies for code under test.
-Under most circumstances KUnit's usage of UML should be treated as an
-implementation detail of how KUnit works under the hood. Nevertheless, there
-are instances where being able to run architecture-specific code or test
-against real hardware is desirable. For these reasons KUnit supports running on
-other architectures.
-
-Running existing KUnit tests on non-UML architectures
------------------------------------------------------
+Exiting Early on Failed Expectations
+------------------------------------
 
-There are some special considerations when running existing KUnit tests on
-non-UML architectures:
+We can use ``KUNIT_EXPECT_EQ`` to mark the test as failed and continue
+execution.  In some cases, it is unsafe to continue. We can use the
+``KUNIT_ASSERT`` variant to exit on failure.
 
-*   Hardware may not be deterministic, so a test that always passes or fails
-    when run under UML may not always do so on real hardware.
-*   Hardware and VM environments may not be hermetic. KUnit tries its best to
-    provide a hermetic environment to run tests; however, it cannot manage state
-    that it doesn't know about outside of the kernel. Consequently, tests that
-    may be hermetic on UML may not be hermetic on other architectures.
-*   Some features and tooling may not be supported outside of UML.
-*   Hardware and VMs are slower than UML.
+.. code-block:: c
 
-None of these are reasons not to run your KUnit tests on real hardware; they are
-only things to be aware of when doing so.
+	void example_test_user_alloc_function(struct kunit *test)
+	{
+		void *object = alloc_some_object_for_me();
 
-Currently, the KUnit Wrapper (``tools/testing/kunit/kunit.py``) (aka
-kunit_tool) only fully supports running tests inside of UML and QEMU; however,
-this is only due to our own time limitations as humans working on KUnit. It is
-entirely possible to support other emulators and even actual hardware, but for
-now QEMU and UML is what is fully supported within the KUnit Wrapper. Again, to
-be clear, this is just the Wrapper. The actualy KUnit tests and the KUnit
-library they are written in is fully architecture agnostic and can be used in
-virtually any setup, you just won't have the benefit of typing a single command
-out of the box and having everything magically work perfectly.
+		/* Make sure we got a valid pointer back. */
+		KUNIT_ASSERT_NOT_ERR_OR_NULL(test, object);
+		do_something_with_object(object);
+	}
 
-Again, all core KUnit framework features are fully supported on all
-architectures, and using them is straightforward: Most popular architectures
-are supported directly in the KUnit Wrapper via QEMU. Currently, supported
-architectures on QEMU include:
+Allocating Memory
+-----------------
 
-*   i386
-*   x86_64
-*   arm
-*   arm64
-*   alpha
-*   powerpc
-*   riscv
-*   s390
-*   sparc
+Where you might use ``kzalloc``, you can instead use ``kunit_kzalloc`` as KUnit
+will then ensure that the memory is freed once the test completes.
 
-In order to run KUnit tests on one of these architectures via QEMU with the
-KUnit wrapper, all you need to do is specify the flags ``--arch`` and
-``--cross_compile`` when invoking the KUnit Wrapper. For example, we could run
-the default KUnit tests on ARM in the following manner (assuming we have an ARM
-toolchain installed):
+This is useful because it lets us use the ``KUNIT_ASSERT_EQ`` macros to exit
+early from a test without having to worry about remembering to call ``kfree``.
+For example:
 
-.. code-block:: bash
+.. code-block:: c
 
-	tools/testing/kunit/kunit.py run --timeout=60 --jobs=12 --arch=arm --cross_compile=arm-linux-gnueabihf-
+	void example_test_allocation(struct kunit *test)
+	{
+		char *buffer = kunit_kzalloc(test, 16, GFP_KERNEL);
+		/* Ensure allocation succeeded. */
+		KUNIT_ASSERT_NOT_ERR_OR_NULL(test, buffer);
 
-Alternatively, if you want to run your tests on real hardware or in some other
-emulation environment, all you need to do is to take your kunitconfig, your
-Kconfig options for the tests you would like to run, and merge them into
-whatever config your are using for your platform. That's it!
+		KUNIT_ASSERT_STREQ(test, buffer, "");
+	}
 
-For example, let's say you have the following kunitconfig:
 
-.. code-block:: none
+Testing Static Functions
+------------------------
 
-	CONFIG_KUNIT=y
-	CONFIG_KUNIT_EXAMPLE_TEST=y
+If we do not want to expose functions or variables for testing, one option is to
+conditionally ``#include`` the test file at the end of your .c file. For
+example:
 
-If you wanted to run this test on an x86 VM, you might add the following config
-options to your ``.config``:
+.. code-block:: c
 
-.. code-block:: none
+	/* In my_file.c */
 
-	CONFIG_KUNIT=y
-	CONFIG_KUNIT_EXAMPLE_TEST=y
-	CONFIG_SERIAL_8250=y
-	CONFIG_SERIAL_8250_CONSOLE=y
+	static int do_interesting_thing();
 
-All these new options do is enable support for a common serial console needed
-for logging.
+	#ifdef CONFIG_MY_KUNIT_TEST
+	#include "my_kunit_test.c"
+	#endif
 
-Next, you could build a kernel with these tests as follows:
+Injecting Test-Only Code
+------------------------
 
+Similar to as shown above, we can add test-specific logic. For example:
 
-.. code-block:: bash
+.. code-block:: c
 
-	make ARCH=x86 olddefconfig
-	make ARCH=x86
+	/* In my_file.h */
 
-Once you have built a kernel, you could run it on QEMU as follows:
+	#ifdef CONFIG_MY_KUNIT_TEST
+	/* Defined in my_kunit_test.c */
+	void test_only_hook(void);
+	#else
+	void test_only_hook(void) { }
+	#endif
 
-.. code-block:: bash
+This test-only code can be made more useful by accessing the current ``kunit_test``
+as shown in next section: *Accessing The Current Test*.
 
-	qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm \
-			   -m 1024 \
-			   -kernel arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage \
-			   -append 'console=ttyS0' \
-			   --nographic
+Accessing The Current Test
+--------------------------
 
-Interspersed in the kernel logs you might see the following:
+In some cases, we need to call test-only code from outside the test file.
+For example, see example in section *Injecting Test-Only Code* or if
+we are providing a fake implementation of an ops struct. Using
+``kunit_test`` field in ``task_struct``, we can access it via
+``current->kunit_test``.
 
-.. code-block:: none
+The example below includes how to implement "mocking":
 
-	TAP version 14
-		# Subtest: example
-		1..1
-		# example_simple_test: initializing
-		ok 1 - example_simple_test
-	ok 1 - example
+.. code-block:: c
 
-Congratulations, you just ran a KUnit test on the x86 architecture!
+	#include <linux/sched.h> /* for current */
 
-In a similar manner, kunit and kunit tests can also be built as modules,
-so if you wanted to run tests in this way you might add the following config
-options to your ``.config``:
+	struct test_data {
+		int foo_result;
+		int want_foo_called_with;
+	};
 
-.. code-block:: none
+	static int fake_foo(int arg)
+	{
+		struct kunit *test = current->kunit_test;
+		struct test_data *test_data = test->priv;
 
-	CONFIG_KUNIT=m
-	CONFIG_KUNIT_EXAMPLE_TEST=m
+		KUNIT_EXPECT_EQ(test, test_data->want_foo_called_with, arg);
+		return test_data->foo_result;
+	}
 
-Once the kernel is built and installed, a simple
+	static void example_simple_test(struct kunit *test)
+	{
+		/* Assume priv (private, a member used to pass test data from
+		 * the init function) is allocated in the suite's .init */
+		struct test_data *test_data = test->priv;
 
-.. code-block:: bash
+		test_data->foo_result = 42;
+		test_data->want_foo_called_with = 1;
 
-	modprobe example-test
+		/* In a real test, we'd probably pass a pointer to fake_foo somewhere
+		 * like an ops struct, etc. instead of calling it directly. */
+		KUNIT_EXPECT_EQ(test, fake_foo(1), 42);
+	}
 
-...will run the tests.
+In this example, we are using the ``priv`` member of ``struct kunit`` as a way
+of passing data to the test from the init function. In general ``priv`` is
+pointer that can be used for any user data. This is preferred over static
+variables, as it avoids concurrency issues.
 
-.. note::
-   Note that you should make sure your test depends on ``KUNIT=y`` in Kconfig
-   if the test does not support module build.  Otherwise, it will trigger
-   compile errors if ``CONFIG_KUNIT`` is ``m``.
+Had we wanted something more flexible, we could have used a named ``kunit_resource``.
+Each test can have multiple resources which have string names providing the same
+flexibility as a ``priv`` member, but also, for example, allowing helper
+functions to create resources without conflicting with each other. It is also
+possible to define a clean up function for each resource, making it easy to
+avoid resource leaks. For more information, see Documentation/dev-tools/kunit/api/test.rst.
 
-Writing new tests for other architectures
------------------------------------------
+Failing The Current Test
+------------------------
 
-The first thing you must do is ask yourself whether it is necessary to write a
-KUnit test for a specific architecture, and then whether it is necessary to
-write that test for a particular piece of hardware. In general, writing a test
-that depends on having access to a particular piece of hardware or software (not
-included in the Linux source repo) should be avoided at all costs.
+If we want to fail the current test, we can use ``kunit_fail_current_test(fmt, args...)``
+which is defined in ``<kunit/test-bug.h>`` and does not require pulling in ``<kunit/test.h>``.
+For example, we have an option to enable some extra debug checks on some data
+structures as shown below:
 
-Even if you only ever plan on running your KUnit test on your hardware
-configuration, other people may want to run your tests and may not have access
-to your hardware. If you write your test to run on UML, then anyone can run your
-tests without knowing anything about your particular setup, and you can still
-run your tests on your hardware setup just by compiling for your architecture.
+.. code-block:: c
 
-.. important::
-   Always prefer tests that run on UML to tests that only run under a particular
-   architecture, and always prefer tests that run under QEMU or another easy
-   (and monetarily free) to obtain software environment to a specific piece of
-   hardware.
-
-Nevertheless, there are still valid reasons to write an architecture or hardware
-specific test: for example, you might want to test some code that really belongs
-in ``arch/some-arch/*``. Even so, try your best to write the test so that it
-does not depend on physical hardware: if some of your test cases don't need the
-hardware, only require the hardware for tests that actually need it.
-
-Now that you have narrowed down exactly what bits are hardware specific, the
-actual procedure for writing and running the tests is pretty much the same as
-writing normal KUnit tests. One special caveat is that you have to reset
-hardware state in between test cases; if this is not possible, you may only be
-able to run one test case per invocation.
+	#include <kunit/test-bug.h>
 
-.. TODO(brendanhiggins@google.com): Add an actual example of an architecture-
-   dependent KUnit test.
+	#ifdef CONFIG_EXTRA_DEBUG_CHECKS
+	static void validate_my_data(struct data *data)
+	{
+		if (is_valid(data))
+			return;
 
-KUnit debugfs representation
-============================
-When kunit test suites are initialized, they create an associated directory
-in ``/sys/kernel/debug/kunit/<test-suite>``.  The directory contains one file
+		kunit_fail_current_test("data %p is invalid", data);
 
-- results: "cat results" displays results of each test case and the results
-  of the entire suite for the last test run.
+		/* Normal, non-KUnit, error reporting code here. */
+	}
+	#else
+	static void my_debug_function(void) { }
+	#endif
 
-The debugfs representation is primarily of use when kunit test suites are
-run in a native environment, either as modules or builtin.  Having a way
-to display results like this is valuable as otherwise results can be
-intermixed with other events in dmesg output.  The maximum size of each
-results file is KUNIT_LOG_SIZE bytes (defined in ``include/kunit/test.h``).
