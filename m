Ah, makes perfect sense.

Yeah, I think you are correct.

Agreed, although you do make a good point below that we would need the
fix in the stable trees, which adds additional complexity when it comes
to things like bisecting. It is already hard enough with all the various
clang behavior changes we have had to adapt to over the years...

but this does not sound like it would be the end of the world, I do not
have to bisect too often and even if I have to, using a userspace
without these headers is generally possible.
