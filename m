Hi Arnd,

thank you for your review.

Thanks! I agree with what you pointed out in the single patches, I will wait for
Thomas to review them as well and then will address all the comments in v7.

I thought about it and I ended up with what proposed in this patchset mainly for
symmetry across all the architectures since in the end they use the same common
code.

It seems also that there is some performance impact (i.e.):

clock-getres-monotonic:    libc(system call): 296 nsec/call
clock-getres-monotonic:    libc(vdso): 5 nsec/call


I agree with you though when you say that caching it in the libc is a
possibility to overcome the performance impact.

A way to address this issue would be to use versioning, which seems supported in
the vdso library (i.e. arch/x86/entry/vdso/vdso32/vdso32.lds.S).

For example for x86 (vdso32) we would have something like:

VERSION
{
	LINUX_5.3 (being optimistic here :) ) {
	global:
                __vdso_clock_getres;
                __vdso_clock_gettime64;
        };
        LINUX_2.6 {
        global:
                __vdso_clock_gettime;
                __vdso_gettimeofday;
                __vdso_time;
        };

        LINUX_2.5 {
        global:
                __kernel_vsyscall;
                __kernel_sigreturn;
                __kernel_rt_sigreturn;
        local: *;
        };
}

What do you think? Would this be a viable solution?
