I agree, and in a way, I feel like that is what is happening here for
this original submission.  See below for more...

I agree, dual licensed code that is added to the kernel is either done:
	- because the original code had a non-GPL license and it was
	  added so that it could be compatible so that it could be added
	  to Linux.
	- because the code being accepted into Linux can also be used in
	  another non-Linux codebase now or in the future.

The submission here was neither of these.

It was to test core Linux kernel functionality that is ONLY GPL-v2.
That functionality and interactions within the Linux core could never be
used in any non-Linux project as it does not make any sense.  Or if it
could be used in a non-Linux project, that would only be if that project
was also GPLv2 licensed as the kernel core code would have been copied
out of Linux into that other project.

I feel that the dual-license of this code is purely done to support an
additional license and give it attention as it could never be invoked on
this codebase due to the contents of it.  Which makes it not necessary
and has only distracted us from the real technical issues of why I
rejected this code in the first place :(

thanks,
