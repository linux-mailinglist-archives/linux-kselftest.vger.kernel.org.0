Thank you so much for sharing the issue and reproducer.

After remapping the second part of the memory and m-protecting +
m-unprotecting the whole memory, the PTE of the first half of the memory
doesn't get marked as soft dirty even after writing multiple times to it.
Even if soft-dirtiness is cleared on the whole process, the PTE of the
first half memory doesn't get dirty. This seems like more of a bug in
mprotect. The mprotect should not mess up with the soft-dirty flag in the PTEs.

I'm debugging this. I hope to find the issue soon. Soft-dirty tracking in
PTEs should be working correctly irrespective of the VM_SOFTDIRTY is set or
not on the VMA.

Cyrill has said in [1]:
> ioctl might be an option indeed
It brings some hope to this patch-set.
