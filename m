Aargh, Sorry to miss that. Yes, it ends up being bogus in the case where the
loop broke out early due to failure (but only on the first PMD move failure
AFAICS). In the success case (or failures after the first PMD move), it does
not matter because old_addr is updated to what it was without the
optimization.

I think that will fix it (thanks!). The main thing I think is to not mess up
the second call to move_page_tables() in mremap where it tries to move the
half-moved stuff back:

  move_page_tables(new_vma, new_addr, vma, old_addr, moved_len,  true);

There moved_len comes from the return value of the first call to
move_page_tables().

If we realigned, and then the first PMD alloc failed, moved_len might be
negative as you pointed. If the first PMD move passed, then there is no
issue as I mentioned above.

I will fix this in the next revision and also add a test case for this, I am
wondering how to test it without some kind of error-injection to make the
first PMD copy fail. In any case, I will try to hack my local kernel to test
that.

thanks,

 - Joel
