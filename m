At minimum, one mask (required, any or excluded) must be specified. For a
page to get selected, the page flags must fulfill the criterion of all the
specified masks.

If a flag is present in both required_mask and excluded_mask, the
required_mask would select a page. But exculded_mask would drop the page.
So page page would be dropped. It is responsibility of the user to
correctly specify the flags.

matched = true;
if (p->required_mask)
	matched = ((p->required_mask & bitmap) == p->required_mask);
if (matched && p->anyof_mask)
	matched = (p->anyof_mask & bitmap);
if (matched && p->excluded_mask)
	matched = !(p->excluded_mask & bitmap);

if (matched && bitmap) {
	// page selected
}

Do you accept/like this behavior of masks after explaintation?

Lets translate words into table:
pageflags	required_flags	negated_flags	matched
1		1		0		yes
0		1		1		yes

pageflags	anyof_flags	negated_flags	matched
1		1		0		yes
0		1		1		yes

All the masks are optional. If all or any of the 3 masks are specified, the
page flags must pass these masks to get selected.

After taking a while to understand this and compare with already present
flag system, `negated flags` is comparatively difficult to understand while
already present flags seem easier.
