I implemented the feature for the second approach I mentioned above.  The
initial version of the feature has recently merged[1] into the mainline as a
part of 6.14-rc1 MM pull request.  DAMON user-space tool (damo) is also updated
for baisc support of it.  I forgot updating that on this thread, sorry.

This makes sense to me.  And yes, I believe DAMOS filters for memcg could also
be used for this use case, since we can install and use multiple DAMOS filters
in combinations.

The documentation of the feature is not that good and there are many rooms to
improve.  You might not be able to get what you want in a perfect way with the
current implementation.  But we will continue improving it, and I believe we
can make it faster if efforts are gathered.  Of course, I could be wrong, and
whether to use it or not is up to each person :)

Anyway, please feel free to ask me questions or any help about the feature if
you want.

DAMON basically exposes its internal information via DAMON sysfs, and DAMON
user-space tool (damo) uses it.  In this case, per-memcg working set could also
be retrieved in the way (directly from DAMON sysfs or indirectly from damo).

But, yes, I think we could make new and optimized ABIs for exposing the
information to user-space in more efficient way depending on the use case, if
needed.  DAMON modules such as DAMON_RECLAIM and DAMON_LRU_SORT provides their
own ABIs that simplified and optimized for their usages.
