OK, makes sense.

Sure.  "Hairy and probably a terrible idea" is not the same as
"impossible", but you need to know what you're doing and you get
exposed to all sorts of portability challenges.

There's a limit to how much we should attempt to smooth over all that.

Anyway, I think what the GCS patches are doing looks reasonable.
