Agreed, it would be nice to unify things. In my v2 I had anon/shmem
and hugetlbfs behaving differently in this respect, for the same
reason - it was just overlooked / cargo culted from existing code. If
nothing else I think a single ioctl should be consistent across memory
types! Heh.

But I also think you're right and it's not exactly intentional that
copy / zeropage / etc are different in this respect. Some unification
would be nice, although I'm not 100% sure what that looks like
concretely.

My rule of thumb is, in cases where we can't imagine a real use case,
it's better to be too strict rather than too loose. And in the future,
it's less disruptive to loosen restrictions rather than tighten them
(potentially breaking something which used to work).

I'll leave untangling this to some future series, though.
