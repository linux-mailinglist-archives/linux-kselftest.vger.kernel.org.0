No. I mean nest the whole thing *under* the check for S1PIE.

Exactly. That's where it belongs, because we never execute EL0 while a
vcpu is loaded. On the contrary, we can make use of a uaccess helper
while a vcpu is loaded, and that makes a hell of a difference.

And it makes a difference because it would allow the loading of
EL0-specific context differently. We had this at some point, and it
was a reasonable optimisation that we lost. I'm keen on bringing it
back.

This emails enumerate, point after point, everything that needs to be
done. I really cannot be clearer or more direct. This email is the
clearer I can be, short of writing the code myself. And I have decided
not to do it for once, unless I really need to. And as it turns out, I
don't.

This is clear: Everything is writable, and there are no bits here that
are otherwise conditional or unsupported.

Same thing.

This one needs fixing because of LS64, and I have an in-progress
series for it.

I don't really see what it would buy us, but never mind.
