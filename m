This seems extremely conservative, but ok. As you note, PKRU is the
only XSTATE component you could theoretically do this subset
save/restore with in the KVM ABI since all the others really do have
their hardware behavior.

You meant ustate->... here (since this is before the copy now), but
yes, ok, I will do that.
