When using kunit as is to unit test kernel functionality - obviously.

When running it to integration test the syscall boundary - not at all.

None of that is true.  While running syscall level tests from an
initramfs could be a nice feature for an automatd kernel CI system,
nothin in this tests should require running from an initramfs.

You are adding kernel code both at the source and object level to run
userspace tests.  That is very clearly bloat.  Even more so as it adds
functionality and exports that don't fit in with what the kernel already
does for actual kernel functionality.

Well, why do you even mix it up with this unrelated series then?

You'll need that for any userspace program, no matter what test
harness.

Well, a libc you will need anyway.  Maybe nolibc is good enough for
some tests, but as you already stated not for very many.  The others
are just an artifcat of how you run tests.

You don't need a rootfs.

Absolutely.

You've still failed why using kunit is the goal and not just something
that made your life easier archieving your goal.

So now having another half-assed test framework is a good thing?

Basically any kind of testing framework that has broad use.  It's not
like there aren't userland unit test frameworks if you really want to
use that.
