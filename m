Adding John Oggness into CC.

John, please CC Brendan Higgins on the patchsets eventually switching
printk() into the lockless buffer. The test framework is going to
do its own buffering to keep the related messages together.

The lockless ringbuffer might make handling of related (partial)
lines worse or better. It might justify KUnit's extra buffering
or it might allow to get rid of it.

I see.

BTW: I wonder if KUnit could reuse the existing seq_buf implementation
for buffering messages.

I am sorry if it has already been proposed and rejected for some
reason. I might have missed it. Feel free to just point me to
same older mail.

I guess that it should not affect KUnit.

The only problem might be if the testing framework calls printk()
inside scheduler or console code. And only when the tested code
uses the same locks that will be used by the called printk().

To be honest I do not fully understand KUnit design. I am not
completely sure how the tested code is isolated from the running
system. Namely, I do not know if the tested code shares
the same locks with the system running the test.

Petr
