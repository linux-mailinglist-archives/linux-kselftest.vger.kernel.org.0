The operations where the shadow stack has to be processed need to be
executable from async-signal context, so this imposes a requirement to
block all signals around the lock. This makes all longjmps a heavy,
multi-syscall operation rather than O(1) userspace operation. I do not
think this is an acceptable implementation, especially when there are
clearly superior alternatives without that cost or invasiveness.

I'm not clear why 2 (suppression of #CP) is desirable at all. If
shadow stack is being disabled, it should just be disabled, with
minimal fault handling to paper over any racing operations at the
moment it's disabled. Leaving it on with extreme slowness to make it
not actually do anything does not seem useful.

Is there some way folks have in mind to use option 2 to lazily disable
shadow stack once the first SS-incompatible code is executed, when
execution is then known not to be in the middle of a SS-critical
section, instead of doing it right away? I don't see how this could
work, since the SS-incompatible code could be running from a signal
handler that interrupted an SS-critical section.

No, I was just interpreting "uphill battle". I really do not want to
engage in an uphill battle for the sake of making it practical to
support something that was never my goal to begin with. If I'm
misreading this, or if others are willing to put the effort into that
"battle", I'd be happy to be mistaken about "not amenable".
