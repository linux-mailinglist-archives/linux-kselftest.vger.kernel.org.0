I agree about the complexity, and I hope we can reduce that further. 
Otherwise such things end up being a maintainance nightmare.

I think whatever we do, we should

a) never talk about any of the implementation details (mapcount, 
swapcount, PAE) towards the users

b) make it clear from the start that we might change the decision when 
we fail (to the better or the worse); users should be prepared to 
implement backup paths. We certainly don't want such behavior to be ABI.

I'd suggest documenting something like the following

"The operation may fail for various reasons. Usually, remapping of pages 
that are not exclusive to the given process fail; once KSM might 
dedduplicate pages or fork() COW-shares pages during fork() with child 
processes, they are no longer exclusive. Further, the kernel might only 
perform lightweight checks for detecting whether the pages are 
exclusive, and return -EWHATSOEVER in case that check fails. To make the 
operation more likely to succeed, KSM should be disabled, fork() should 
be avoided or MADV_DONTFORK should be configured for the source VMA 
before fork()."

To me, if we're talking about moving data, then zero-copy is the 
optimization and copy+delete would be the (slower) default.

If we're talking about remapping, then there is no copy; we're remapping 
pages.


So if we'd ever want to support the copy case, one combination would be

UFFDIO_MOVE + UFFDIO_MOVE_ZERO_COPY_ONLY

whereby we would fail if the latter is not specified.

But just my thoughts.
