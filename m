But then wouldn't we want to limit what KUnit changes are going into
linux-kselftest next for v5.5? For example, we probably don't want to
do anymore feature development on it until it is in v5.5, since the
goal is to make it more stable, right?

I am guessing that it will probably be fine, but it still sounds like
we need to establish some ground rules, and play it *very* safe.
