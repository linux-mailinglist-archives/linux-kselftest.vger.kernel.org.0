Let me check if there are use cases that require moves between MMs.
Andrea seems to have put considerable effort to make it work between
MMs and it would be a pity to lose that. I can send a follow-up patch
to recover that functionality and even if it does not get merged, it
can be used in the future as a reference. But first let me check if we
can drop it.

Yeah, it might be the right time to clean that up. Will do.
