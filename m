There is a qemu process that currently has mappings of what guest sees as
its physical memory, but qemu is a part of hypervisor, i.e. host.

Isn't "syscalls have completely independent description" specific enough?

We are talking about API here, not the implementation details whether
secretmem supports large pages or not.

The purpose of memfd_create() is to create a file-like access to memory.
The purpose of memfd_secret() is to create a way to access memory hidden
from the kernel.

I don't think overloading memfd_create() with the secretmem flags because
they happen to return a file descriptor will be better for users, but
rather will be more confusing.
