The issues are also there when I use

   make O=/somewher TARGETS=kvm

from tools/testing/selftests/ directory,

Is it the right usecase?

I have read the Makefile in futex, arm64, android to learn how they
deal with subdir, they have Makefile in subdir but kvm doesn't.

I just want to create the subdir as easy as possible, so I follow the 
method how to create subdir for LIBKVM_OBJ in kvm.

If you dislike it way you can reply it Patch 1 to disclaim clear what 
you want to fix the subdir.

I don't want to build kernel at all.

Oh no. This needs to define INSTALL_PATH, and I don't want to install.
I just want to build the testcase of kvm to anywhere else to make srcdir 
clean.

Besides this command make both kernel src and selftest/kvm dirty.

OK.

So, again.

is

   make O=/tmp/kvm-selftest -C tools/testing/selftests \
        TARGETS=kvm install INSTALL_PATH=/home/lxy/kvm-selftest

the right command for me to start on?
