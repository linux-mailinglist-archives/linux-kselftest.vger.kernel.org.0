Hmm, it seems I've been dragging this paragraph from the very first
mmap(MAP_EXCLUSIVE) rfc and nobody (including myself) noticed the
inconsistency.

The current implementation does not help to remove the memory from the
process, but using fd-backed memory seems a better interface to remove
guest memory from host mappings than mmap. As Andy nicely put it:

"Getting fd-backed memory into a guest will take some possibly major work in
the kernel, but getting vma-backed memory into a guest without mapping it
in the host user address space seems much, much worse."

Well, the phrasing could be better indeed. That supposed to mean that
they differ in the semantics behind the file descriptor: memfd_create
implements sealing for shmem and hugetlbfs while memfd_secret implements
memory hidden from the kernel.

Isn't this implied? ;-)
I'll add a sentence about it.
