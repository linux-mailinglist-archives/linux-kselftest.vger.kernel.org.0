Ok, that makes sense, but even if passed via an rx queue I'd
at least hope it keeping abstract provider parameters, e.g.
ops, but not hard coded with devmem specific code.

It might even be better done with a helper like
create_page_pool_from_queue(), unless there is some deeper
interaction b/w pp and rx queues is predicted.

Right, it was with RFCv3

Then page_pool_iov_put_many() should and supposedly would never be
called by non devmap code because all puts must circle back into
->release_page. Why adding it to into page_pool_page_put_many()?

Well, I'm looking at this new branch from Patch 10, it can put
the buffer, but what if we race at it's actually the final put?
Looks like nobody is going to to bump up pages_state_release_cnt

If you remove the branch, let it fall into ->release and rely
on refcounting there, then the callback could also fix up
release_cnt or ask pp to do it, like in the patch I linked above
