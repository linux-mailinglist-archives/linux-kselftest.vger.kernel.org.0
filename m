Off hand I don't see the need for a new create_page_pool_from_queue().
page_pool_create() already takes in a param arg that lets us pass in
the queue as well as any other params.

Good catch, I think indeed the release_cnt would be incorrect in this
case. I think the race is benign in the sense that the ppiov will be
freed correctly and available for allocation when the page_pool next
needs it; the issue is with the stats AFAICT.

Sadly I don't think this is possible due to the reasons I mention in
the commit message of that patch. Prematurely releasing ppiov and not
having them be candidates for recycling shows me a 4-5x degradation in
performance.

What I could do here is detect that the refcount was dropped to 0 and
fix up the stats in that case.
