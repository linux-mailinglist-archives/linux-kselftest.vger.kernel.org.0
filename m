Aha, cute.  So NV-1 is only sent if the target is directly paying attent=
ion and, assuming all the atomics are done right, NV-2 will be sent for =
tasks that are asleep.

Logically, I think these are the possible states for a receiving task:

1. Running.  SENDUIPI will actually deliver the event directly (or not i=
f uintr is masked).  If the task just stopped running and the atomics ar=
e right, then the schedule-out code can, I think, notice.

2. Not running, but either runnable or not currently waiting for uintr (=
e.g. blocked in an unrelated syscall).  This is straightforward -- no IP=
I or other action is needed other than setting the uintr-pending bit.

3. Blocked and waiting for uintr.  For this to work right, anyone trying=
 to send with SENDUIPI (or maybe a vdso or similar clever wrapper around=
 it) needs to result in either a fault or an IPI so the kernel can proce=
ss the wakeup.

(Note that, depending on how fancy we get with file descriptors and poll=
ing, we need to watch out for the running-and-also-waiting-for-kernel-no=
tification state.  That one will never work right.)

3 is the nasty case, and your patch makes it work with this NV-2 trick. =
 The trick is a bit gross for a couple reasons.  First, it conveys no us=
eful information to the kernel except that an unknown task did SENDUIPI =
and maybe that the target was most recently on a given CPU.  So a big li=
st search is needed.  Also, it hits an essentially arbitrary and possibl=
y completely innocent victim CPU and task, and people doing any sort of =
task isolation workload will strongly dislike this.  For some of those u=
sers, "strongly" may mean "treat system as completely failed, fail over =
to something else and call expensive tech support."  So we can't do that.

I think we have three choices:

Use a fancy wrapper around SENDUIPI.  This is probably a bad idea.

Treat the NV-2 as a real interrupt and honor affinity settings.  This wi=
ll be annoying and slow, I think, if it's even workable at all.

Handle this case with faults instead of interrupts.  We could set a rese=
rved bit in UPID so that SENDUIPI results in #GP, decode it, and process=
 it.  This puts the onus on the actual task causing trouble, which is ni=
ce, and it lets us find the UPID and target directly instead of walking =
all of them.  I don't know how well it would play with hypothetical futu=
re hardware-initiated uintrs, though.
