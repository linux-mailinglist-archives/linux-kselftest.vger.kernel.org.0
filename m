That is true for io_uring as well, but io_uring can't wait for socket
tear down as it holds socket refs

If, for example, you store the xarray with userspace buffers in a
netlink socket and implement DONT_NEED setsockopt against it, you
would be able to return bufs after the TCP socket is closed. FWIW,
I'm not saying you should or even want to have it this way.

Absolutely, mentioned just to entertain with a design consideration

Yes, and it's a slow path, but I'll look at removing it anyway in
later rfcs.

In terms of devmem that would be if you attach userspace buffers
to the netlink socket instead of a TCP socket as mentioned above,
not that much different
