I was planning on holding off on accepting more tests/changes until
KUnit is in torvalds/master. As much as I would like to go around
promoting it, I don't really want to promote too much complexity in a
non-upstream branch before getting it upstream because I don't want to
risk adding something that might cause it to get rejected again.

To be clear, I can understand from your perspective why getting more
tests/usage before accepting it is a good thing. The more people that
play around with it, the more likely that someone will find an issue
with it, and more likely that what is accepted into torvalds/master is
of high quality.

However, if I encourage arbitrary tests/improvements into my KUnit
branch, it further diverges away from torvalds/master, and is more
likely that there will be a merge conflict or issue that is not related
to the core KUnit changes that will cause the whole thing to be
rejected again in v5.5.

I don't know. I guess we could maybe address that situation by splitting
up the pull request into features and tests when we go to send it in,
but that seems to invite a lot of unnecessary complexity. I actually
already had some other tests/changes ready to send for review, but was
holding off until the initial set of patches mad it in.

Looking forward to hearing other people's thoughts.
