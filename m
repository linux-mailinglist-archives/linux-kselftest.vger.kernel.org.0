Aah, I think I'm starting to understand the issue now. Basically, with
the current UAPI, the semantics have to be "an access is permitted if,
for each policy layer, at least one rule encountered on the pathwalk
permits the access; rules that deny the access are irrelevant". And if
it turns out that someone needs to be able to deny access to specific
inodes, we'll have to extend struct landlock_path_beneath_attr.

That reminds me... if we do need to make such a change in the future,
it would be easier in terms of UAPI compatibility if
landlock_add_rule() used copy_struct_from_user(), which is designed to
create backwards and forwards compatibility with other version of UAPI
headers. So adding that now might save us some headaches later.

I don't think you can avoid storing the access rights per layer unless
you actually merge the layers when setting up the ruleset (which would
be messy). But I don't think that's a big problem. A straightforward
implementation might become inefficient if you stack too many policy
layers, but I don't think that's a problem for an initial
implementation - the common usecase is probably going to be a single
layer, or maybe two, or something like that?

If you had a ton of layers, most of them would likely specify the same
access permissions - so one possible optimization might be to use the
current representation if all rules matching the inode specify the
same permissions, and use a different representation otherwise. But I
don't think such an optimization is necessary at this point.
