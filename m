It's definitely possible to use writes or pops to achive the same
effect, it's just that it's less likely to be something that happens
through simple oversight than missing a flag off the initial map call
would be.

Yes, exactly - if we make the top of stack record optional then if that
flag is omitted we'd not do that.

Sure, though if we're going to the trouble of checking for the flag we
probably may as well implement it.  I guess x86 is locked in at this
point by existing userspace.  I guess I'll implement it assuming nobody
=66rom userspace complains, it's trivial for a kernel.

The flags should definitely match, no disagreement there.
