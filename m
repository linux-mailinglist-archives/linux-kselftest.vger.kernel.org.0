Hi T.J. Mercier,

Many thanks for this effort. It caught my attention because we might have a use
case where this feature can be useful for us. Hence I'd like to jump and be part
of the discussion, I'd really appreciate if you can cc'me for next versions.

While reading the full patchset I was a bit confused about the status of this
proposal. In fact, the rfc in the subject combined with the number of iterations
(already seven) confused me. So I'm wondering if this is a RFC or a 'real'
proposal already that you want to land.

If this is still a RFC I'd remove the 'rfc: Proposal' and use the more canonical
way that is put RFC in the []. I.e [PATCH RFC v7] cgroup: Add a GPU cgroup
controller.

If it is not, I'd just remove the RFC and make the subject in the cgroup
subsystem instead of the gpu. I.E [PATCH v7] cgroup: Add a GPU cgroup

I don't want to nitpick but IMO that helps new people to join to the history of
the patchset.

As far as I can see the only thing that is adding here is the accounting, so I'd
remove any reference to limiting and just explain what the patch really
introduces, not the future, otherwise is confusing an you expect more than the
patch really does.

It is important maintain the commit message sync with what the patch really
does.

I think this is material for the cover more than the commit message. When I read
this I was expecting all this in this patch.

I think this is outdated, you are using cgroup v2, right?

When I applied the full series I was expecting see the memory allocated by the
gpu devices or users of the gpu in this file but, after some experiments, what I
saw is the memory allocated via any process that uses the dma-buf heap API (not
necessary gpu users). For example, if you create a small program that allocates
some memory via the dma-buf heap API and then you cat the gpu.memory.current
file, you see that the memory accounted is not related to the gpu.

This is really confusing, looks to me that the patches evolved to account memory
that is not really related to the GPU but allocated vi the dma-buf heap API. IMO
the name of the file should be according to what really does to avoid
confusions.

So, is this patchset meant to be GPU specific? If the answer is yes that's good
but that's not what I experienced. I'm missing something?

If the answer is that evolved to track dma-buf heap allocations I think all the
patches need some rework to adapt the wording as right now, the gpu wording
seems confusing to me.
