I do plan a v2, if for no other reason than to update the
documentation. Happy to add a cover letter with it as well.

+Jiaqi back to CC, this is one piece of a larger memory poisoning /
recovery design Jiaqi is working on, so he may have some ideas why
MADV_HWPOISON or MADV_PGER will or won't work.

One idea is, at least for our use case, we have to have the range be
userfaultfd registered, because we need to intercept the first access
and check at that point whether or not it should be poisoned. But, I
think in principle a scheme like this could work:

1. Intercept first access with UFFD
2. Issue MADV_HWPOISON or MADV_PGERR or etc to put a pte denoting the
poisoned page in place
3. UFFDIO_WAKE to have the faulting thread retry, see the new entry, and SI=
GBUS

It's arguably slightly weird, since normally UFFD events are resolved
with UFFDIO_* operations, but I don't see why it *couldn't* work.

Then again I am not super familiar with MADV_HWPOISON, I will have to
do a bit of reading to understand if its semantics are the same
(future accesses to this address get SIGBUS).
