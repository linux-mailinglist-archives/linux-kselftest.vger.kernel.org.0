Thanks! I do not remember all the details from the past discussion
except it was /proc and later global setting. Neither really were great
choices. We have discussed pidfd_madvise and prctl IIRC. For the latter
there was no real argument about when it is desirable to apply merging
on all existing vmas (e.g. is it really desirable on stack/brk or malloc
arenas or would user need to opt out for those).

I have read through your cover letter and it talks about the interface
but it doesn't really talk about usecases and how they are supposed to
use this feature - except the prctl based flag gets inherited. So could
you elaborate some more about those usecases please?
