I'd just say "cleared by execve()."

"Spawn" suggests (v)fork+exec to me (at least, what's what "spawn" means on
certain other OSes).

For both prctls, you should also document the zeroed arguments up to
arg5 (unless we get rid of the enforcement and just ignore them).


Is there a canonical way to detect whether this whole API/ABI is
available?  (i.e., try to call this prctl / check for an HWCAP bit,
etc.)
