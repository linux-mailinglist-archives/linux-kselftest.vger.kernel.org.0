I found out last week that I had misunderstood S2POR_EL1, so yes looks like
we need to trap that. I will add that in.

Can you give me some clarification here?
	
	- By visible to the host userspace do you mean via the GET_ONE_REG API?
	- Currently the ID register (ID_AA64MMFR3_EL1) is not ID_WRITABLE,
	  should this series or another make it so? Currently if the host had
	  POE it's enabled in the guest, so I believe migration to a non-POE
	  host will fail?
	- For the context switch, do you mean something like:

		if (system_supports_poe() && ID_REG(MMFR3_EL1) & S1POE)
			ctxt_sys_reg(ctxt, POR_EL0)     = read_sysreg_s(SYS_POR_EL0);

	  That would need some refactoring, since I don't see how to access
	  id_regs from struct kvm_cpu_context.

Thanks,
Joey
