So, first policy:

/a RW

You mean with the second policy looking like this?

/a RW
/a/b R

Then the resulting policy would be:

/a RW policy_bitmask=3D0x00000003 (bits 0 and 1 set)
/a/b R policy_bitmask=3D0x00000002 (bit 1 set)
required_bits=3D0x00000003 (bits 0 and 1 set)

But with the solution I proposed, landlock's path walk would see
something like this when accessing a file at /private/b/foo:
/private/b/foo <no rules>
  policies seen until now: 0x00000000
/private/b <access: R, policy_bitmask=3D0x00000002>
  policies seen until now: 0x00000002
/private <no rules>
  policies seen until now: 0x00000002
/ <no rules>
  policies seen until now: 0x00000002

It wouldn't encounter any rule from the first policy, so the OR of the
seen policy bitmasks would be 0x00000002, which is not the required
value 0x00000003, and so the access would be denied.
