In case you're interested -- I've also included a selftest based on this
attack in my series (though it uses CLONE_FILES so that we could also
test O_EMPTYPATH, which wasn't affected because it didn't go through
procfs and thus couldn't hit the "outdated inode->i_mode" problem).

The attack script succeeds around 20% of the time on the original
patchset, and with the updated patchset it doesn't succeed in several
hundred thousand attempts (which I've repeated a few times).
