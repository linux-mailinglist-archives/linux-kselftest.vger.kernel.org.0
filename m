That turned to be a spurious hypothesis on my part -- LTO isn't the
smoking gun.  (See below.)

So, after a bit of further experimentation, I found that I could trigger
it with implicit function calls on an older compiler.  I couldn't show
it with explicit function calls (as in your example).

With the following code, inlining if an expression that causes an
implicit call to a libgcc helper can trigger this issue, but I had to
try an older compiler:

int foo(int x, int y)
{
	register int res asm("r0");
	register const int x_ asm("r0") = x;
	register const int y_ asm("r1") = y;

	asm volatile (
		"svc	#0"
		: "=r" (res)
		: "r" (x_), "r" (y_)
		: "memory"
	);

	return res;
}

int bar(int x, int y)
{
	return foo(x, x / y);
}

I was struggling to find a way to emit an implicit function call for
AArch64, except for 128-bit divide, which would complicate things since
uint128_t doesn't fit in a single register anyway.

Maybe this was considered a bug and fixed sometime after GCC 5, but I
think the GCC documentation is still quite unclear on the semantics of
register asm vars that alias call-clobbered registers in the PCS.

If we can get a promise out of the GCC folks that this will not happen
with any future compiler, then maybe we could just require a new enough
compiler to be used.

Then of course there is clang.
