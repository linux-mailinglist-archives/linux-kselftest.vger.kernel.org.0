You mean in the near term future? Your change makes it use the full file.
Just checking.

I'd prefer to see it separate, and we fix the race *before* we introduce
the new functionality. I'll be poking at that shortly but I should note
that I leave on vacation this weekend and won't be back for a good while.
I already have an idea of how to approach this.

When the current user want to use the new API it can do so, and then we
just kill the older caller.

If the new user is going to move to the API once available I will be
happy to then leave out testing for the older API. That would make
sense.

But if you do want to keep testing for the old API, and allow an easy
removal for it on the test driver, wouldn't a function pointer suffice
for which API call to use based on a boolean?

But yeah if we're going to abandon the old mechanism I'm happy to skip
its testing.
