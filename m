I would drop the pool altogether and instantiate pages to the
unevictable LRU list and internally treat it as ramdisk/mlock so you
will get an accounting correctly. The feature should be still opt-in
(e.g. a kernel command line parameter) for now. The recent report by
Intel (http://lkml.kernel.org/r/213b4567-46ce-f116-9cdf-bbd0c884eb3c@linux.intel.com)
there is no clear win to have huge mappings in _general_ but there are
still workloads which benefit.

If this is opt-in then those beliefs can be relaxed somehow. Long term
it makes a lot of sense to optimize for a better direct map management
but I do not think this is a hard requirement for an initial
implementation if it is not imposed to everybody by default.

As already mentioned, a mechanism to control who can use this feature -
e.g. make it a special device which you can access control by
permissions or higher level security policies. But that is really needed
only if the pool is fixed sized.

It would be better than OOM but it would still be a terrible interface.
So I would go that path only as a last resort. I do not even want to
think what kind of security consequences that would have. E.g. think of
somebody depleting the pool and pushing security sensitive workload into
fallback which is not backed by security memory.
