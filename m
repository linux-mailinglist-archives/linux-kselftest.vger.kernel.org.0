All fair, but some of us need to write code that must handle being
invoked from a wide variety of contexts.  Now perhaps you like the idea of
call_rcu() for schedulable contexts, call_rcu_nosched() when preemption
is disabled, call_rcu_irqs_are_disabled() when interrupts are disabled,
call_rcu_raw_atomic() from contexts where (for example) raw spinlocks
are held, and so on.  However, from what I can see, most people instead
consistently prefer that the RCU API instead be consolidated.

Some in-flight cache-efficiency work for kvfree_rcu() and call_rcu()
needs to be able to allocate memory occasionally.  It can do that when
invoked from some contexts, but not when invoked from others.  Right now,
in !PREEMPT kernels, it cannot tell, and must either do things to the
memory allocators that some of the MM hate or must unnecessarily invoke
workqueues.  Thomas's patches would allow the code to just allocate in
the common case when these primitives are invoked from contexts where
allocation is permitted.

If we want to restrict access to the can_schedule() or whatever primitive,
fine and good.  We can add a check to checkpatch.pl, for example.  Maybe
we can go back to the old brlock approach of requiring certain people's
review for each addition to the kernel.

But there really are use cases that it would greatly help.
