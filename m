I think it also depends on the details of how to invalidate buffers
posted to the rx queue of a particular driver. For GVE as far as I
understands when the queue is started I believe it allocates a bunch
of buffers and posts them to the rx queue. Then it processes the
completion descriptors from the hardware and posts new buffers to
replace the ones consumed, so any started queue would have postesd
buffers in it.

As far as I know we also don't support invalidating posted buffers
without first stopping the queue, replacing the buffers, and starting
again. But I don't think these are limitations overly specific to GVE,
I believe non-RDMA NICs work similarly?

But I'd stress that what I'm proposing here should be extensible to
capabilities of specific drivers. If one has a driver that allows them
to invalidate posted buffers on the fly, I imagine they can extend the
queue API to declare that support to the netstack in a genric way, and
the net stack can invalidate buffers from the previous page pool and
supply the new one.

We support that by flow steering different flows to different RX
queues. Our NICs don't support smart choosing of which page_pool to
place the packet in (based on ntuple rule or what not). So flows that
must land on a given dmabuf are flow steered to that dmabuf, and flows
that need to land host memory and not flow steered and are RSS'd to
the non-dmabuf bound queues. This should also be extensible by folks
that have NICs with the appropriate support.

Thanks, glad to hear that. I was afraid there is a miscommunication here.
