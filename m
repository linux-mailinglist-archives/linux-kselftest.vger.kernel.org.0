I tried exactly the inverse of that when originally adding
MSG_ZEROCOPY: to allow piggy-backing zerocopy completion notifications
on sendmsg calls by writing to sendmsg msg_control on return to user.
It required significant code churn, which the performance gains did
not warrant. Doing so also breaks the simple rule that recv is for
reading and send is for writing.

We're doing that in the optional cmsg handling of recvmsg, which is
already a slow path (compared to the data read() itself).

I see. I'm a bit concerned if we start limiting what we can do in
sockets because of dependencies that BPF processing places on them.
The use case for BPF [gs]etsockopt is limited to specific control mode
calls. Would it make sense to just exclude calls like
SO_DEVMEM_DONTNEED from this interpositioning?

At a high level what we really want is a high rate metadata path from
user to kernel. And there are no perfect solutions. From kernel to
user we use the socket error queue for this. That was never intended
for high event rate itself, dealing with ICMP errors and the like
before timestamps and zerocopy notifications were added.

If I squint hard enough I can see some prior art in mixing data and
high rate state changes within the same channel in NIC descriptor
queues, where some devices do this, e.g.,  { "insert encryption key",
"send packet" }. But fundamentally I think we should keep the socket
queues for data only.
