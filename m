this does not work in a hosted c implementation unless the libc
guarantees not to use libc internal fds (e.g. in execve).
(the libc cannot easily abstract fds, so the syscall abi layer
fd semantics is necessarily visible to user code.)

i think this is a new constraint for userspace runtimes.
(not entirely unreasonable though)

was cloexec_range(a,b) considered?

assuming there is no unblocked signal handler that may open fds.

a syscall that tramples on fds not owned by the caller is ugly
(not generally safe to use and may break things if it gets used),
i don't have a better solution for fd leaks or missing cloexec,
but i think it needs more analysis how it can be used.
