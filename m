Ack, if this is a known limitation then I guess it makes sense just to
follow other arches.

I see that we default the shadow stack size to half the main stack size,
which should indeed count as "huge".  I guess this makes shadow stack
overrun unlikely at least (at least, not before the main stack
overruns).


Hopping to an alternate (main) stack while continuing to push on the
same shadow stack doesn't sound broken in principle.

Is there a test for taking and returning from a signal on an alternate
(main) stack, when a shadow stack is in use?  Sounds like something
that would be good to check if not.

Cheers
