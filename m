These are implementation details which are not really relevant to the
API IMHO.

Those angels have made their way to mmap, System V shm, memfd_create and
other MM interfaces which have never envisioned when introduced. Hugetlb
pages to back guest memory is quite a common usecase so why do you think
those guests wouldn't like to see their memory be "secret"?

As I've said in my last response (YCZEGuLK94szKZDf@dhcp22.suse.cz), I am
not going to argue all these again. I have made my point and you are
free to take it or leave it.

No, I did not see where the ioctl argument came from.

OK I see. How many potential modes are we talking about? A few or
potentially many?

OK, I do not necessarily see a lack of flag space a problem. I can be
wrong here but I do not see how that would be solved by a separate
syscall when it sounds rather forseeable that many modes supported by
memfd_create will eventually find their way to a secret memory as well.
If for no other reason, secret memory is nothing really special. It is
just a memory which is not mapped to the kernel via 1:1 mapping. That's
it. And that can be applied to any memory provided to the userspace.

But I am repeating myself again here so I better stop.
