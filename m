This bullet point needs to be re-written. The sysctl is meant to disable
opting in to the ABI. I'd also drop the "meant for testing" part. I put
it in my commit log as justification but I don't think it should be part
of the ABI document.

I don't have a strong preference either way. If it's simpler for the
user to ignore them, fine by me. I can see in the current prctl commands
a mix if ignore vs forced zero.

I think we should drop this guarantee. It would have made sense if we
allowed tagged pointers everywhere but we already have some exceptions.

I fully agree. It should talk about PR_SET_MM, PR_SET_MM_MAP,
PR_SET_MM_MAP_SIZE.
