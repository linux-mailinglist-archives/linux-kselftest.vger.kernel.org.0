I don't have a specific need for this right now.  I had not thought about
how the current kunit implementation forces all kunit tests to run at a
specific initcall level before reading this email thread.

I can see the value of being able to have some tests run at different
initcall levels to verify what functionality is available and working
at different points in the boot sequence.

But more important than early initcall levels, I do not want the
framework to prevent using or testing code and data that are marked
as '__init'.  So it is important to retain a way to invoke the tests
while __init code and data are available, if there is also a change
to generally invoke the tests later.
