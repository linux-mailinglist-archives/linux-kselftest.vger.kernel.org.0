If I'm not mistaken, some syscalls were dropped from kernel in the past, 
after it was established they are no longer used. So it is not 
impossible, though might be more difficult specifically with futex.

Yes, implementing futex1 in terms of futex2 internally is a possible way 
forward. Though I'm not sure it is reasonable to require that to be done 
in the initial futex2 submission. This requires all of the futex1 
functionality to implemented in futex2 from the start, which I think is 
too much to ask. Even with some futex1 features missing, futex2 would be 
already very much useful to users, and it is easier to implement the 
missing bits incrementally over time.

Also, one other point I'd like to make is that not all futex1 features 
might need to be reimplemented if futex2 provides a better alternative. 
For example, as a user, I would like to see a different approach to 
robust futexes that does not mandate a single user (libc) and allows to 
use robust futexes directly.

I think, Andr√© will answer this, but my guess is, as stated above, this 
is a lot of work and time while the intermediate version is already useful.
