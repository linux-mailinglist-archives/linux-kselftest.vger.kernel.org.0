Fair enough.  Sorry if I wasn't clear when asking, the reason to ask was that I
wanted to be clear on these differences.  For example, in my uffd-wp shmem
series I'll have to make sure dirty bit always there, I used pte_mkdirty()
unconditionally but I wanted to make sure I'm not overlooking anything..

Though this case is slightly special here, since if without the cleaning up the
logic will definitely be harder to review (with the cleanup, it'll be as simple
as one unconditional pte_mkdirty() and that's all).  However you're definitely
right, it's not a reason to overload Axel with this patchset, especially if
such a cleanup is seen to be risky.

OK. Maybe I can clean this after Axel's work.

Thanks a lot for all these details, Hugh!
