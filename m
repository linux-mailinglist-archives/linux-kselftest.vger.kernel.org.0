Oops, so I remove returning on pte marker detection. Instead the last else
is already setting marker wp-ed.

I was only testing for WP and WP Async in pagemap_scan_test_walk() as WP
async can only be enabled if unpopulated is enabled which in turn enables
the markers. I'll add userfaultfd_wp_use_markers() to pagemap_scan_test_walk().

Alright. At first sight, it seems I should return -EAGAIN here. But there
maybe a case where there are 3 THPs. I've cleared WP over the first THP and
put data in the user buffer. If I return -EAGAIN, the data in the user
buffer would be not used by the user correctly as negative value has been
returned. So the best way here would be to skip this second VMA and don't
abort the operation. Thus we'll not be giving any information about the
second THP as it was in transition.

I'll think about it again before sending next version.
