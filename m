Sure, I was just thinking that getting other people to write the tests
would be better. Since not only is it then useful to someone else, it
provides the best possible exercise of KUnit.

Nevertheless, it would probably just be easier to get a handful of
example tests, and it is less likely to result in any issues for v5.5,
so that's probably better. (I think that is what you are hinting at
here. ;-) )

Hey Ted, do you know if that ext4 timestamp test can go in through
linux-kselftest? It seemed fairly self-contained. Or is that what you
were saying wouldn't work for you?

I agree. That is the most important thing.

Sure.

Cheers!
