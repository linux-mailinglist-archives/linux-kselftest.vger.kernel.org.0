It seems simpler at first glance, but I prefer to follow the same
implementation as clone3(2) and openat2(2) because it is the same
(generic) struct argument parsing, which may then be handled by seccomp
and others, while adding a variable struct size depending on some flags
seems more complex to handle correctly and error-prone.

As explained in the commit message, this command/syscall enables to get
the Landlock supported features (i.e. option flags, commands, etc.),
which is required for backward and forward compatibility, and
best-effort security, while having strict kernel errors when
encountering unknown features. Cf.
https://landlock.io/linux-doc/landlock-v19/security/landlock/user.html

There is some use cases where userspace would benefit from this:

Because of backward and forward compatibility, one important case is for
common usage libraries, to help and encourage developers to not ignore
all security features if some are missing. Indeed, if from the start we
have get_features(), userland logic will be able to leverage it to
seamlessly enforce access-controls as much as possible whatever is the
running kernel.

For userland, being able to not trigger kernel errors (because userland
knows what is supported) enables to log them as real anomalies, which
can then help for debugging and understanding issues.

Landlock may also be combined with seccomp, but with different filters
according to the number of features the running kernel supports (e.g. an
app could filter some syscalls if they can't be restricted by the
running kernel through Landlock). Another point is that while seccomp
could be used as an alternative for some missing access-control from
Landlock, using seccomp for this could have a different impact on
performances (i.e. running BPF filters for each syscalls vs. controlling
access to kernel objects).

Another use case is that a system integrator should be aware that some
security features required by applications are not available. This may
be implemented as logging some warnings, or displaying the supported
security features as Chromium does (i.e. chrome://sandbox/).

This is also useful for (self)tests to ensure that a specific security
feature works as intended.

To sum up, get_features() and the strict kernel error codes enable
application developers to have a contract with the kernel. Multiple
use-cases can then be managed in userspace.

I agree.

Good! What do you think about these 4 new Landlock syscalls?

Because they don't exist yet, it seems risky to assume that they could
fit into a common form.

Yes, a file descriptor (i.e. parent_fd) may not make sense to identify
every rule types. For example, it does not help to identify a network
subnet.

Even if it may be "shared", the allowed_access semantic depends on the
object type. It should also remain a 64-bits value to hold enough access
rights. I think it is more consistent, safer, and simpler to keep it in
the same pointed struct.

This would freeze the pointed struct to a fixed size, which may lead to
redundant struct parsing in the kernel. For example, the current
extended struct enables to extend struct landlock_attr_path_beneath with
a "path" field, which could have the same usage as in openat(2) to avoid
multiple calls to open(2) and close(2) to add new paths. If we have a
fixed-size struct, adding such field would require to create a new type
and I think it would make the kernel code more complex.

The "options" and "flags" seems confusing. For optional future flags, I
think that the name "options" is more explicit than "flags". What about
an "options" (set to zero for now) and a "rule_type" field to clearly
differentiate the rule type identifier (and use an enum)?
This would look like this:
SYSCALL_DEFINE5(landlock_add_rule, int, ruleset, __u32, options, __u32,
rule_type, const void __user *, rule_ptr, size_t, rule_size);
