So I started looking into this based on what we talked about at the last
guest_memfd sync. I tried to sort of go the way you hinted at when this
topic of "direct map removal from modules" came up in the past [1], and
hide it behind some sort of "alloc/free" abstraction. E.g. have the
library/shim expose gmem_get_folio(struct inode *inode, pgoff_t index)
that is a sorta equivalent of today __kvm_gmem_get_pfn(), which grabs a
new folio from the filemap, prepares it via a callback provided by KVM,
and then direct map removes it before returning it proper. But then,
that could still be "abused" by module code to just remove arbitrary
folios from the direct map, if a caller messed up any old struct inode
to look sufficiently like a gmem inode for the purposes of
gmem_get_folio(). But I also couldn't really come up with anything that
_wouldn't_ allow something like this. What're your thoughts on this? Do
we need to find a way to prevent this sort of stuff, and is that even
possible? I checked some of Elliot's old submissions that contain
direct map removal as part of the library and they run into the
same problem.

Best, 
Patrick
