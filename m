General question, using this series as an illustration only:


At the risk of starting a flamewar, why is this needed?  Is there a
realistic usecase that would get significant benefit from this?

A lot of syscalls seem to get added that combine or refactor the
functionality of existing syscalls without justifying why this is
needed (or even wise).  This case feels like a solution, not a
primitive, so I wonder if the long-term ABI fragmentation is worth the
benefit.

I ask because I'd like to get an idea of the policy on what is and is
not considered a frivolous ABI extension.

(I'm sure a usecase must be in mind, but it isn't mentioned here.
Certainly the time it takes top to dump the contents of /proc leaves
something to be desired.)

Cheers
---Dave
