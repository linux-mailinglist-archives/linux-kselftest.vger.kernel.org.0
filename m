I just haven't seen that code land in Linus's tree yet so I am a bit
cautious in adopting that.  It is definitely needed as the behavior
of IMA as v6.18 simply does not work in general.

From the usenet comp.unix.faq that was probably updated in 1994:
    http://www.faqs.org/faqs/unix-faq/faq/part4/section-7.html

I have been trying to remember enough details by looking it up, but the
short version is that one of the big problems is there is a race between
the kernel doing it's thing and the shell opening the shell script.

Clever people have been able to take advantage of that race and insert
arbitrary code in that window for the shell to execute.  All you have to
do is google for how to find a reproducer if the one in the link above
is not enough.

After 30 years I really don't expect that is even a reasonable request.

I think we are solidly into "Don't do that then", and the LSM security
hooks are definitely doing that.

There is the partial solution of passing /dev/fd instead of passing the
name of the script.  I suspect that would break things.  I don't
remember why that was never adopted.

I think even with the TOCTOU race fixed there were other serious issues.

I really think it behooves any security module people who want to use
the shell script as the basis of their security decisions to research
all of the old well known issues and describe how they don't apply.

All I have energy for is to point out it is broken as is and to start
moving code down into bprm_creds_from_file to avoid the race.

Right now as far as I can tell anything based upon the script itself
is worthless junk so changing that would not be breaking anything that
wasn't already broken.

Which is a problem for the people making the rules engine.  Because
30 years of experience with this problem says basing anything on the
script is already broken.

I understand the frustration, but it requires a new way of launching
shell scripts to even begin to make it secure.

Yep.

Historically it hasn't been safe.

I am hoping someone who helped put these security hooks where they are
will speak up, and tell me what I am missing.

All I have the energy for right now is to point out security policies
based upon shell scripts appear to be security policies that only
protect you from well behaved programs.
