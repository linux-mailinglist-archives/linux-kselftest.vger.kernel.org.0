Seems like that settles it then. Thanks!

Cool! Can you CC me on that discussion?

Noted. Yeah, I would prefer avoiding printing out the info at a separate time.

Sure, I think Stephen's concern is all the supporting code that is
involved. Not printk specifically. It just means a lot more of KUnit
has to be IRQ safe.

That shouldn't affect us though, right? As long as we continue to use
the printk interface?
