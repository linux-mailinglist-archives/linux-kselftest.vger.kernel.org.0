Most of the expectations and assertions in this patchset are fairly
simple, and what you are describing would probably work. However, I
have some expectations I plan on adding in later patchsets that make
much more complicated checks.

I have some expectations in follow up patchsets for which I created a
set of composable matchers for matching structures and function calls
that by their nature cannot be written as a single function. The
matcher thing is a bit speculative, I know, but for any kind of
function call matching, you need to store a record of functions you
are expecting to have called and then each one needs to have a set of
expectations defined by the user; I don't think there is a way to do
that that doesn't involve having multiple separate functions each
having some information useful to constructing the message.

I know the code in question isn't in this patchset; the function
matching code was in one of the earlier versions of the RFC, but I
dropped it to make this patchset smaller and more manageable. So I get
it if you would like me to drop it and add it back in when I try to
get the function and structure matching stuff in, but I would really
prefer to keep it as is if you don't care too much.

No, that should work. It picks up where the macro ends up being
finally evaluated.

Yeah, that's fair. I think there are a number of improvements to be
made with how the expectations are defined other than that, but I was
hoping I could do that after this patchset is merged. I just figured
with the kinds of things I would like to do, it would lead to a whole
new round of discussion.

In either case, I think I would still like to use the `struct
kunit_stream` as part of the interface to share the failure message
with the test case runner code in test.c, at least eventually, so that
I only have to have one way to receive data from expectations, but I
think I can do that and still do what you suggest by just constructing
the kunit_stream at the end of expectations where it is feasible.

All in all I agree with what you are saying, but I would rather do it
as a follow up possibly once we have some more code on the table. I
could just see this opening up a whole new can of worms where we
debate about exactly how expectations and assertions work for another
several months, only to rip it all out shortly there after. I know
that's how these things go, but that's my preference.

I can do what you suggest if you feel strongly about it, but I would
prefer to hold off until later. It's your call.

See above comments.
