I think this gets awkward. Trying to define sensible semantics for what 
happens if a shmem or similar fd gets used as secret guest memory and 
that fd isn't utterly and completely empty can get quite nasty.  For 
example:

If there are already mmaps, then TDX (much more so than SEV) really 
doesn't want to also use it as guest memory.

If there is already data in the fd, then maybe some technologies can use 
this for pre-population, but TDX needs explicit instructions in order to 
get the guest's hash right.


In general, it seems like it will be much more likely to actually work 
well if the user (uAPI) is required to declare to the kernel exactly 
what the fd is for (e.g. TDX secret memory, software-only secret memory, 
etc) before doing anything at all with it other than binding it to KVM.

INACCESSIBLE is a way to achieve this.  Maybe it's not the prettiest in 
the world -- I personally would rather see an explicit request for, say, 
TDX or SEV memory or maybe the memory that works for a particular KVM 
instance instead of something generic like INACCESSIBLE, but this is a 
pretty weak preference.  But I think that just starting with a plain 
memfd is a can of worms.
