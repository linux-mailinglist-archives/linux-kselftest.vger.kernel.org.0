Sounds good, "unified-image" is a bit close to "unified kernel image"
(UKI) which is similar but different.

What about kernel-standalone?

I'd like to keep the build self-contained. But actually the kernel build
will always build a minimal initramfs if CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD is set.
This config is needed for the nolibc testsuite in any case.

The fact that the initrd is always build means that usr/gen_init_cpio
is also always build.
So we can add "kernel" as a prerequisite to "initramfs.cpio" and
everything should work out without any buildsystem modifications.

Fine for me, let's keep it :-)
