Compile anything that accesses it for (say) sparc and look at the object code.
You really, really, REALLY, don't want to EVER use 'packed'.

Just use u64 for all the fields.
Use 'flags' bits to indicate whether the additional fields should be looked at.
Error if a 'flags' bit requires a value that isn't passed in the structure.

Then you can add an extra field and old source code recompiled with the
new headers will still work - because the 'junk' value isn't looked at.
