TDX 1.5 brings both.

In TDX speak, mm migration called relocation. See TDH.MEM.PAGE.RELOCATE.

These idiosyncrasies are well known: user who used hugetlbfs may want to
get direct replacement that would tap into the same hugetlb reserves and
get the same allocation guarantees. Admins know where to look if ENOMEM
happens.

For THP, admin may know how to tweak allocation/defrag policy for his
liking and how to track if they are allocated.

That's a nice list of clues that would need to be re-implemented somewhere
else to get competent solution.

From a quick look, these are orthogonal. But it is not your point.

Yes, INACCESSIBLE is increase of complexity which you do not want to deal
with in shmem.c. It get it.

I will try next week to rework it as shim to top of shmem. Does it work
for you?

But I think it is wrong to throw it over the fence to KVM folks and say it
is your problem. Core MM has to manage it.

That's the hint users know about from previous experience.
