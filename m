It's a dangerous business, going out of your subsystem. You step into
code, and if you don't watch your hands, there is no knowing where you
might be swept off to.

That saying goes for me here specifically...

In the current implementation you would have to put in effort to fake
this. For example, you would need to also implement ->statfs
super_operation where you'd need to fill in the details of the tmpfs
instance. At that point all that memfd_restricted fs code that you've
written is nothing but deadweight, I would reckon.

Ok. But just to point this out, this would make memfd_restricted()
a multiplexer on types of memory. And my wild guess is that not all
memory types you might reasonably want to use will have a filesystem
like interface such. So in the future you might end up with multiple
ways of specifying the type of memory:

// use tmpfs backing
memfd_restricted(fd_tmpfs, 0);

// use hugetlbfs backing
memfd_restricted(fd_hugetlbfs, 0);

// use non-fs type memory backing
memfd_restricted(-EBADF, MEMFD_SUPER_FANCY_MEMORY_TYPE);

interface wise I find an unpleasant design. But that multi-memory-open
goal also makes it a bit hard to come up with a clean design (On
possibility would be to use an extensible struct - versioned by size -
similar to openat2() and clone3() such that you can specify all types of
options on the memory in the future.).

Ok, see my comment above then.

Not necessarily difficult, just difficult to do tastefully imho. But
it's not that has traditionally held people back. ;)

Well, hopefully we can complement each other's knowledge here.

Maybe, but I think it's weird. _Replacing_ f_ops isn't something that's
unprecedented. It happens everytime a character device is opened (see
fs/char_dev.c:chrdev_open()). And debugfs does a similar (much more
involved) thing where it replaces it's proxy f_ops with the relevant
subsystem's f_ops. The difference is that in both cases the replace
happens at ->open() time; and the replace is done once. Afterwards only
the newly added f_ops are relevant.

In your case you'd be keeping two sets of {f,a}_ops; one usable by
userspace and another only usable by in-kernel consumers. And there are
some concerns (non-exhaustive list), I think:

* {f,a}_ops weren't designed for this. IOW, one set of {f,a}_ops is
  authoritative per @file and it is left to the individual subsystems to
  maintain driver specific ops (see the sunrpc stuff or sockets).
* lifetime management for the two sets of {f,a}_ops: If the ops belong
  to a module then you need to make sure that the module can't get
  unloaded while you're using the fops. Might not be a concern in this
  case.
* brittleness: Not all f_ops for example deal with userspace
  functionality some deal with cleanup when the file is closed like
  ->release(). So it's delicate to override that functionality with
  custom f_ops. Restricted memfds could easily forget to cleanup
  resources.
* Potential for confusion why there's two sets of {f,a}_ops.
* f_ops specifically are generic across a vast amount of consumers and
  are subject to change. If memfd_restricted() has specific requirements
  because of this weird double-use they won't be taken into account.

I find this hard to navigate tbh and it feels like taking a shortcut to
avoid building a proper api. If you only care about a specific set of
operations specific to memfd restricte that needs to be available to
in-kernel consumers, I wonder if you shouldn't just go one step further
then your proposal below and build a dedicated minimal ops api. Idk,
sketching like a madman on a drawning board here with no claim to
feasibility from a mm perspective whatsoever:

struct restrictedmem_ops {
	// only contains very limited stuff you need or special stuff
	// you nee, similar to struct proto_ops (sockets) and so on
};

struct restrictedmem {
	const struct restrictedmem_ops ops;
};

This would avoid fuzzing with two different set of {f,a}_ops in this
brittle way. It would force you to clarify the semantics that you need
and the operations that you need or don't need implemented. And it would
get rid of the ambiguity inherent to using two sets of {f,a}_ops.
