Then the patch title of 'sysfs: fix deadlock race with module removal'
is wrong.

Again, can you share the related zram code about the issue? In
zram_drv.c of linus or next tree, I don't see any lock is held before
calling del_gendisk().

IMO your generalization isn't good or correct because this kind of issue
is _not_ related with module exit at all. What matters is just that one lock is
held before calling device_del(), meantime the same lock is required
in the device's attribute show/store function().

There are many cases in which we call device_del() not from module_exit(),
such as scsi scan, scsi sysfs store(), or even handling event from
device side, nvme error handling, usb hotplug, ...

It might be just the only two drivers(zram and live patch) with this bug, and
it is one simply AA bug in driver. Not mention I don't see such usage in
zram_drv.c.

What is the lock in zram? Again can you share the related functions?

What matters is that the lock is held before calling device_del()
instead of being held in module_exit().
