Hi Brendan,

I am only responding to this because you asked me to in the v4 thread.

Thank you for evaluating my comments in the v4 thread and asking me to
comment on v5

I looked only at this section, as was specifically requested:

The in-kernel tests can also be invoked at boot time if they are
configured (Kconfig) as in-kernel instead of as modules.  I did not
check how many of the tests have tri-state configuration to allow
this, but the few that I looked at did.

I would call that description a little dismissive.  The set of in-kernel
tests that I looked like followed a common pattern and reported results
in a uniform manner.

You missed many tests.  I listed much more than that in the v4 thread, and
someone else also listed more in the v4 thread.

The description does not give enough credit to what is in kselftest.

It does not matter whether KUnit provides additional things, relative
to kselftest.  The point I was making is that there appears to be
_some_ overlap between kselftest and KUnit, and if there is overlap
then it is worth considering whether the overlap can be unified instead
of duplicated.

I don't have a dog in this fight and the discussion in the v4 thread
went way off track.  Thus I am not going to get sucked back into a
pointless debate in this thread.

Thanks for adding this section to address the issue.
