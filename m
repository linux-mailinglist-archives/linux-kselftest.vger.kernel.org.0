I explain bellow.

Definitely, I forgot this, thanks for the outside perspective!

Yes that was the intent.

This can be explained with the interleaved_masked_accesses test:
https://github.com/landlock-lsm/linux/blob/landlock-v24/tools/testing/selftests/landlock/fs_test.c#L647

In this case there is 4 stacked layers:
layer 1: allows s1d1/s1d2/s1d3/file1
layer 2: allows s1d1/s1d2/s1d3
         denies s1d1/s1d2
layer 3: allows s1d1
layer 4: allows s1d1/s1d2

In the v23, access to file1 would be allowed until layer 3, but layer 4
would merge a new rule for the s1d2 inode. Because we don't record where
exactly the access come from, we can't tell that layer 2 allowed access
thanks to s1d3 and that its s1d2 rule was ignored. I think this behavior
doesn't make sense from the user point of view.

In the v24, access to file1 would only be allowed with layer 1. The
layer 2, would deny access to file1 because of the s1d2 rule. This makes
the reasoning consistent and deterministic whatever the layers are,
while storing the same access and layer bits. But I agree that this may
not be desirable.

In a perfect v25, file1 should be allowed by all these layers. I didn't
find a simple solution to this while minimizing the memory allocated by
rule (cf. struct landlock_rule: mainly 32-bits for access rights and
64-bits for the layers that contributed to this ANDed accesses). I would
like to avoid storing 32-bits access rights per stacked layer. Do you
see another solution?

Right, I should add a test for this case anyway.
