The commit that introduced that 5% bound plainly admitted it's "randomly 
chosen value". At least that wasn't vague, I guess. :-)

So what I'm trying to do here is to have "randomly chosen value" replaced 
with a value that seems to work well enough based on measurements on 
a large set of platforms.

Personally, I don't care much about this, I can just ignore the failures 
due to outliers (and also reports about failing MBA/MBM test if somebody 
ever sends one to me), but if I'd be one running automated tests it would 
be annoying to have a problem like this unaddressed.

Not really I think. The number just isn't that stable to always remain 
below 5% (even if it usually does).

Only systematic thing I've come across is that if I play with the read 
pattern for defeating the hw prefetcher (you've seen a patch earlier and 
it will be among the series I'll send after this one), it has an impact 
which looks more systematic across all MBM/MBA tests. But it's not what 
I'm trying now address with this patch.

Perhaps, I can try to look into it (add to my todo list so I won't 
forget). But in the meantime, this new value is picked using a criteria 
that looks better than "randomly chosen value". If I ever manage to 
address the outliers, the bound could be lowered again.

I'll update the changelog to explain things better.
