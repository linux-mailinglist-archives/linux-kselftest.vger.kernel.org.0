Thanks for the review.  Yes, I do see the enum being ugly now
and have removed it in v8 of the patch.  Hopefully it addresses
your concerns.  More comments below.

Your point on the enum is valid.
I've removed it from design.  Hopefully it is cleaner now.

I have removed the enum necessary in the kernel pread call now,
so it is down to 6.
The other 2 parameters are necessary as they are in kernel read.

max_size makes no sense to remove - it serves the same purpose
as in userspace pread and read functions.  To specify the max size
to read.

No, they can't.  The caller only calls kernel_read_file once and expects
the whole file to be read.  The kernel_read_file doesn't work like 
userspace.
There is no tracking like userspace of where in the file you read?

Hopefully I'm carving steak now.

Cover letter updated.
