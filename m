Hi,

Sorry to come to this so late; I've been meaning to provide feedback on
this for a while but have been indisposed for a bit due to an injury.

Agreed. I think if we really need something like this, something between
XPFO and DEBUG_PAGEALLOC would be generally better, since:

* Secretmem puts userspace in charge of kernel internals (AFAICT without
  any ulimits?), so that seems like an avenue for malicious or buggy
  userspace to exploit and trigger DoS, etc. The other approaches leave
  the kernel in charge at all times, and it's a system-level choice
  which is easier to reason about and test.

* Secretmem interaction with existing ABIs is unclear. Should uaccess
  primitives work for secretmem? If so, this means that it's not valid
  to transform direct uaccesses in syscalls etc into accesses via the
  linear/direct map. If not, how do we prevent syscalls? The other
  approaches are clear that this should always work, but the kernel
  should avoid mappings wherever possible.

* The uncached option doesn't work in a number of situations, such as
  systems which are purely cache coherent at all times, or where the
  hypervisor has overridden attributes. The kernel cannot even know that
  whther this works as intended. On its own this doens't solve a
  particular problem, and I think this is a solution looking for a
  problem.

... and fundamentally, this seems like a "more security, please" option
that is going to be abused, since everyone wants security, regardless of
how we say it *should* be used. The few use-cases that may make sense
(e.g. protection of ketys and/or crypto secrrets), aren't going to be
able to rely on this (since e.g. other uses may depelete memory pools),
so this is going to be best-effort. With all that in mind, I struggle to
beleive that this is going to be worth the maintenance cost (e.g. with
any issues arising from uaccess, IO, etc).

Overall, I would prefer to not see this syscall in the kernel.

I agree the uncached stuff should be removed. It is at best misleading
since the kernel can't guarantee it does what it says, I think it's
liable to lead to issues in future (e.g. since it can cause memory
operations to raise different exceptions relative to what they can
today), and as above it seems like a solution looking for a problem.

Thanks,
Mark.
