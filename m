A recent addition -- PAGE_IS_HUGE -- is missing.

BTW, it could be easier to understand if the page categories were
separated from the operation description and listed so that each has
its own line and maybe a longer description where needed.

The operation the IOCTL does now is: "scan the process page tables and
report memory ranges matching provided criteria '.
Flags extend the operation: "PM_SCAN_WP_MATCHING write protects the
memory reported" (it does it atomically, but this is just an
optimization, isn't it? A process could gather the ranges, WP them,
and then copy.)
"PM_SCAN_CHECK_WPASYNC" aborts the scan early if a non-WP-able
matching page is found.

Could this be rewritten as examples? E.g.:

Finding dirty file-backed pages:

struct pm_scan_arg arg =3D {
 .size =3D sizeof(arg),
  .flags =3D 0,
 ...
   .category_mask =3D ...,
   .return_mask =3D ...
};
ssize_t n =3D ioctl(..., &arg);

Find dirty pages and write protect them in the same call:

arg =3D { ... };
do {
  ... ioctl(...)
} while(...);

(The code snippets heavily commented.)

This is still an optimization, e.g. in THP case there might be too
many pages reported?

This repeats the description of PM_SCAN_WP_MATCHING -- I suggest
removing this part.

I guess that the UFFD performance could be fixed? But this part refers
to the old PM_SCAN_OP_WP, so an updated example is needed.

"find the pages written to since they were last write protected", but
this sounds contradicting: we look for pages that were WP but written
anyway. (IOW: marking write-protected is an implementation detail -
the ioctl is to find pages that changed since they were last marked.)
Maybe we should call the operation "marking CLEAN" or alike?
