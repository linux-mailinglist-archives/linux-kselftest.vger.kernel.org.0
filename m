Hmm, so we really do get a clear "enable shadow stack" call to the
kernel, which we can reasonaly expect won't happen for ancient software?

If so, I think dumping the GCS state in the sigframe could be made
conditional on that without problems (?)

(We could always make it unconditional later if it turn out that that
approach breaks something.)

Ah, right.  Doing this asynchronously on the back of a signal (instead
of doing a sigreturn) is the bad thing.  setcontext() officially
doesn't work for this any more, and doing it by hacking or rebuilding
the sigframe is extremely hairy and probably a terrible idea for the
reasons I gave.

Note, the way sigcontext (a.k.a. mcontext).__reserved[] is used by
glibc for the ucontext API is inspired by the way the kernel uses it,
but not guaranteed to be compatible.  For the ucontext API glibc
doesn't try to store/restore asynchronous contexts (which is why
setcontext() from a signal handler is totally broken), so there is no
need to store SVE/SME state and hence lots of free space, so this
probably is supportable with shadow stacks -- if there's a way to
allocate them.  This series would be unaffected either way.

(IIRC, the contents of mcontext.__reserved[] is totally incompatible
with what the kernel puts in there, and doesn't have the same record
structure.)

As outlined above, nowadays you can only use setcontext() on a context
obtained from getcontext().  Using setcontext() on a context obtained
from a sigframe works by accident or not at all, but in any case
coroutines always switch synchronously and don't rely on doing this.

(See where setcontext deals with the FPSIMD regs:
https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/aarch64/setcontext.S;h=ba659438c564dc3bbbb8d6039030e2c492649534;hb=HEAD )

So, overall I think making ucontext coroutines with with GCS is purely
a libc matter that is "interesting" here, but we don't need to worry
about.

Agreed, but perhaps not in programs that haven't enabled shadow stack?
