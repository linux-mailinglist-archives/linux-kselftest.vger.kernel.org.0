I'm not sure what do you mean? The buffer-full conditions would be
checked in ..scan_output() and communicated to the caller by returning
N less than `n_pages` passed in. This is exactly how e.g. read()
works: if you get less than requested you've hit the end of the file.
If the file happens to have size that is equal to the provided buffer
length, the next read() will return 0.

Let's then first agree on what would have to be changed. I guess we
could leverage that `scan_len =3D 0` doesn't make much sense otherwise
and let it be used to check the other fields for support.
