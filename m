Code can be refactored if it's identical, not if it is similar. I
suspect the page_pools will be only similar, and if you're not willing
to take devmem handling into the page pool then refactoring page_pool
code into helpers that do devmem handling may also not be an option.

I'm not sure this is actually possible in the short term. The
page_pool uses both page->_refcount and page->pp_frag_count for
refcounting, and I will not be able to remove the special handling
around page->_refcount as i'm not allowed to call page_ref_*() APIs on
a non-struct page.

This function seems to be only called from veth which doesn't support
devmem. I can remove the handling there.

Jakub says PP_FLAG_DMA_MAP must be enabled for devmem, such that the
page_pool handles the dma mapping of the devmem and the driver doesn't
use it on its own.

We may fail creating the page pool on  PP_FLAG_DMA_SYNC_DEV maybe, and
remove the checking from page_pool_sync_for_dev(), I think.
