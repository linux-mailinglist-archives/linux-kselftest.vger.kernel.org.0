Secretmem obeys RLIMIT_MLOCK.
I don't see why it "puts userpspace in charge of kernel internals" more
than other system calls. The fact that memory is dropped from
linear/direct mapping does not make userspace in charge of the kernel
internals. The fact that this is not system-level actually makes it more
controllable and tunable, IMHO.

Our idea was that direct uaccess in the context of the process that owns
the secretmem should work and that transforming the direct uaccesses
into accesses via the linear map would be valid only when allowed
explicitly. E.g with addition of FOLL_SOMETHING to gup.
Yet, this would be required for any implementation of memory areas that
excludes pages from the linear mapping.

As we discussed at one of the previous iterations, the uncached makes
sense for x86 to reduce availability of side channels and I've only
enabled uncached mappings on x86.

I think that making secretmem a file descriptor that only allows mmap()
already makes it quite self contained and simple. There could be several
cases that will need special treatment, but I don't think it will have
large maintenance cost.
I've run syzkaller for some time with memfd_secret() enabled and I never
hit a crash because of it.
