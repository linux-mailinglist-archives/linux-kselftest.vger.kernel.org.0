Heh, commandeer then.

Ya, if we go the route of poking into f_ops and stuff, I would want to add
WARN_ON_ONCE() hardening of everything that restrictemem wants to "commandeer" ;-)

Aha!  I was working on getting rid of it, but forgot to go back and do another
pass.

I think we want those?  What we want to restrict are operations that require
read/write/execute access to the file, everything else should be ok. fallocate()
is a special case because restrictmem needs to tell KVM to unmap the memory when
a hole is punched.  I assume ->setattr() needs similar treatment to handle
ftruncate()?

I'd love to hear Christian's input on this aspect of things.

Ya, sounds right.  I should have added disclaimers that (a) I wrote this quite
quickly and (b) it's compile tested only at this point.

Yep.

Looking at this more closely, I don't think we need to require NOEXEC, things like
like execve() should get squashed by virtue of not providing any read/write
implementations.  And dropping my misguided NOEXEC requirement means there's no
reason to disallow using the kernel internal mount.
