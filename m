Hi Michał,

Thank you so much for comment!

The interface was suggested by Andrei back on the review of v3 [1]:

I've added everyone who may be interested in making interface better.

They are opposite of each other:
All the set bits in required_mask must be set for the page to be selected.
All the set bits in excluded_mask must _not_ be set for the page to be
selected.

Sorry I'm unable to understand the negation (which is XOR?). Lets look at
the truth table:
Page Flag	negated_flags		
0		0			0
0		1			1
1		0			1
1		1			0

If a page flag is 0 and negated_flag is 1, the result would be 1 which has
changed the page flag. It isn't making sense to me. Why the page flag bit
is being fliped?

When Anrdei had proposed these masks, they seemed like a fancy way of
filtering inside kernel and it was straight forward to understand. These
masks would help his use cases for CRIU. So I'd included it. Please can you
elaborate what is the purpose of negation?
