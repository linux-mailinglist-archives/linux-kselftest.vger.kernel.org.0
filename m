The 'user' (ie the kernel code that needs to emulate the call) doesn't
write the data to the stack, just to some per-cpu location.
(Actually it could be on the stack at the other end of pt-regs.)
So you get to the 'register restore and iret' code with the stack unaltered.
It is then a SMOP to replace the %flags saved by the int3 with the %ip
saved by the int3, the %ip with the address of the function to call,
restore the flags (push and popf) and issue a ret.f to remove the %ip and %cs.

(Actually you need to add 4 to the callers %ip address to allow for the
difference between the size of int3 (hopefully 0xcc, not 0xcd 0x3).)

Well, in particular, it always loads %sp as part of the iret.
So you can create a gap and the cpu will remove it for you.

In 64bit mode you could overwrite the %ss with the return address
to the caller restore %eax and %flags, push the function address
and use ret.n to jump to the function subtracting the right amount
from %esp.

Actually that means you can do the following in both modes:
	if not emulated_call_address then pop %ax; iret else
	# assume kernel<->kernel return
	push emulated_call_address;
	push flags_saved_by_int3
	load %ax, return_address_from_iret
	add %ax,#4
	store %ax, first_stack_location_written_by_int3
	load %ax, value_saved_by_int3_entry
	popf
	ret.n

The ret.n discards everything from the %ax to the required return address.
So 'n' is the size of the int3 frame, so 12 for i386 and 40 for amd64.

If the register restore (done just before this code) finished with
'add %sp, sizeof *pt_regs' then the emulated_call_address can be
loaded in %ax from the other end of pt_regs.

This all reminds me of fixing up the in-kernel faults that happen
when loading the user segment registers during 'return to user'
fault in kernel space.
