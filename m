Should the spec say that <attributes list> is test specific (and defined by
the test) and not defined in the ktap specification?

I think there is a balance between under specifying and over specifying
within the ktap specification.  But I think the specification should
be clear about what definition is left open to the test implementations.

My wishy washy thought for the general case is that the ktap specification
should leave as much as choice as possible to the test implementers,
but should provide as much detail as needed to provide general guidance
to parser implementers.

>>> - "# File: <file_path>" to indicate file used in testing

nit question: Should both relative paths and absolute paths be allowed
for <file_path>?  I think both have value in different contexts.

Yes, definitely.  I thought I was blanking on an additional form
of a config option when I wrote that.

I slightly prefer the single option per line. :-)

Those prefixes look good to me.
