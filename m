Why would you say that secretmem allocates from !ZONE_MOVABLE?
If we put boot time reservations aside, the memory allocation for
secretmem follows the same rules as the memory allocations for any file
descriptor. That means we allocate memory with GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE.
After the allocation the memory indeed becomes unmovable but it's not
like we are eating memory from other zones here.

Maybe I'm missing something, but it seems to me that using CMA for any
secretmem allocation would needlessly complicate things.

We can support migration/compaction with temporary mapping. The first
roadblock I've hit there was that migration allocates 4K destination
page and if we use it in secret map we are back to scrambling the direct
map into 4K pieces. It still sounds feasible but not as trivial :)

But again, there is nothing in the current form of secretmem that
prevents allocation from ZONE_MOVABLE.

I lean towards a dedicated syscall because, as I said, to me it would
seem less confusing.
