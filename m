If I read unpoison_memory() correctly, once there is a real hardware
memory corruption (hw_memory_failure will be set), unpoison will stop
working and return EOPNOTSUPP.

I know some cloud providers evacuating VMs once a single memory error
happens, so not supporting unpoison is probably not a big deal for
them. BUT others do keep VM running until more errors show up later,
which could be long after the 1st error.

Per https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/madvise.2.html,
MADV_HWPOISON "is available only for privileged (CAP_SYS_ADMIN)
processes." So for a non-root VMM, MADV_HWPOISON is out of option.

Another issue with MADV_HWPOISON is, it requires to first successfully
get_user_pages_fast(). I don't think it will work if memory is not
mapped yet.

With the UFFDIO_SIGBUS feature introduced in this patchset, it may
even be possible to free the emulated-hwpoison page back to the kernel
so we don't lose a 4K page.

I didn't find any ref/doc for MADV_PGERR. Is it something you suggest
to build, Peter?
