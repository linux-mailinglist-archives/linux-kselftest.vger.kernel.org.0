Subject: [PATCH v5 00/11] Add futex2 syscalls

This patchset is an implementation of futex2 interface on top of existing
futex.c code.

* What happened to the current futex()?

The futex() is implemented using a multiplexed interface that doesn't
scale well and gives headaches to people. We don't want to add more
features there.

* New features at futex2()

 ** NUMA-awareness

 At the current implementation, all futex kernel side infrastructure is
 stored on a single node. Given that, all futex() calls issued by
 processors that aren't located on that node will have a memory access
 penalty when doing it.

 ** Variable sized futexes

 Futexes are used to implement atomic operations in userspace.
 Supporting 8, 16, 32 and 64 bit sized futexes allows user libraries to
 implement all those sizes in a performant way. Thanks Boost devs for
 feedback: https://lists.boost.org/Archives/boost/2021/05/251508.php

 Embedded systems or anything with memory constrains could benefit of
 using smaller sizes for the futex userspace integer.

 ** Wait on multiple futexes

 Proton's (a set of compatibility tools to run Windows games) fork of Wine
 benefits of this feature to implement WaitForMultipleObjects from Win32 in 
 a performant way. Native game engines will benefit from this as well,
 given that this is  a common wait pattern for games.

* The interface

The new interface has one syscall per operation as opposed to the
current multiplexing one. The details can be found in the following
patches, but this is a high level summary of what the interface can do:

 - Supports wake/wait semantics, as in futex()
 - Supports requeue operations, similarly as FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE, but with
   individual flags for each address
 - Supports waiting for a vector of futexes, using a new syscall named
   futex_waitv()

 - The following features will be implemented in next patchset versions:
    - Supports variable sized futexes (8bits, 16bits, 32bits and 64bits)
    - Supports NUMA-awareness operations, where the user can specify on
      which memory node would like to operate

* The patchset

Given that futex2 reuses futex code, the patches make futex.c functions
public and modify them as needed.

This patchset can be also found at my git tree:

https://gitlab.collabora.com/tonyk/linux/-/tree/futex2-dev

  - Patch 1: Implements 32bit wait/wake

  - Patches 2-3: Implement waitv and requeue.

  - Patch 4: Add a documentation file which details the interface and
    the internal implementation.

  - Patches 5-10: Selftests for all operations along with perf
    support for futex2.

  - Patch 11: Proof of concept of waking threads at waitpid(), not to be
  merged as it is.

* Testing

 ** Stability

 - glibc[1]: nptl's low level locking was modified to use futex2 API
   (except for PI). All nptl/ tests passed.

 - Proton's Wine: Proton/Wine was modified in order to use futex2() for the
   emulation of Windows NT sync mechanisms based on futex, called "fsync".
   Triple-A games with huge CPU's loads and tons of parallel jobs worked
   as expected when compared with the previous FUTEX_WAIT_MULTIPLE
   implementation at futex(). Some games issue 42k futex2() calls
   per second.

 - perf: The perf benchmarks tests can also be used to stress the
   interface, and they can be found in this patchset.

 ** Performance

 - Using perf, no significant difference was measured when comparing
 futex() and futex2() for the following benchmarks: hash, wake and
 wake-parallel.

 - I measured a 15% overhead for the perf's requeue benchmark, comparing
 futex2() to futex(). Requeue patch provides more details about why this
 happens and how to overcome this.

* Changelog

- Use existing futex.c code when possible
- Cleaned up cover letter, check v4 for a more verbose version
