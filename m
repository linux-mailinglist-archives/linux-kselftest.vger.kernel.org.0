I just realized that since these dma_fence structs are refcounted and
userspace can hold references (directly, it can pass them around
behind file descriptors) we might never hit such a path until slightly
unusual or evil userspace does something interesting. Do you have
links to those patches? Some googling didn't turn up anything. I can
then figure out whether it's better to risk not spotting issues with
call_rcu vs slapping a memalloc_noio_save/restore around all these
critical section which force-degrades any allocation to GFP_ATOMIC at
most, but has the risk that we run into code that assumes "GFP_KERNEL
never fails for small stuff" and has a decidedly less tested fallback
path than rcu code.
