We should be alright without since we'll eventually have an ERET to EL0.

Well, I'd say either we are clear about why it's (not) needed or we ask
the architects to clarify the spec. I haven't checked your latest
series but in principle I don't like adding barriers just because we are
not sure they are needed (and I don't think having hardware eventually
changes this).
