Well, I added ARCH_EPHEMERAL_INODES for Landlock specifically because of 
this hostfs inconsistency, and it is not used by anything else in the 
kernel: https://git.kernel.org/torvalds/c/cb2c7d1a1776
I then think it makes sense to remove this Kconfig option with the 
hostfs change. Moreover, this protects against erroneously backporting 
the ARCH_EPHEMERAL_INODES change, which would silently introduce a bug 
for Landlock.

Can I add your Signed-off-by to this patch (without touching 
ARCH_EPHEMERAL_INODES changes, but removing the Cc stable)?

Are you OK for me to push this patch (with the whole series) in the 
Landlock and next tree?

I'll send a new series splitting the Landlock tests to make a patch 
dedicated to Landlock with hostfs tests (not backported), and with 
another patch containing backportable and independent new Landlock FS tests.
