I'm sure Mike can add it.

I wouldn't say "melt" ... one of the Demos we did a FOSDEM was using
gdb/ptrace to extract secrets and then showing it couldn't be done if
secret memory was used.  You can still trace the execution of the
process (and thus you could extract the secret as it's processed in
registers, for instance) but you just can't extract the actual secret
memory contents ... that's a fairly limited and well defined
restriction.

Sure, but we thought "secret" covered it.  It wouldn't be secret if
gdb/ptrace from another process could see it.

I think disallowing PROT_EXEC is a great enhancement.

I actually thought we forced it, so I'll let Mike address this.  I
think allowing it is great, so the secret memory isn't inherited by
children, but I can see use cases where a process would want its child
to inherit the secrets.

Technically no because copy_from_user goes via the userspace page
tables which do have access.

Right, but this is on the radar of several people and when fixed will
strengthen the value of secret memory.

It doesn't prevent privilege escalation from happening in the first
place, but once the escalation has happened it protects against
exfiltration by the newly minted root attacker.

Right, that's why I call it "enhanced protection".  With ROP the design
goal is to take exfiltration beyond the simple, and require increasing
complexity in the attack ... the usual security whack-a-mole approach
... in the hope that script kiddies get bored by the level of
difficulty and move on to something easier.
