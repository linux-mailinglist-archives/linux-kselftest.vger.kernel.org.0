It is only related in the sense that the sysfs/module unloading race
happened *after* this other issue, but addressing these through
separate threads created a break in conversation and focus. For
instance, a theoretical race was mentioned in one thread, which
I worked to prove/disprove and then I disproved it was not possible.

But at this point, yes, this is a purely separate issue, and this
patch *should* be picked up already.

Andrew, can you merge this? It already has the respective maintainer
Ack, and I can continue to work on the rest of the patches. The only
issue I can think of would be a conflict with the last patch but
that's a oneliner, I think chances are low that would create a conflict
if its all merged separately, and if so, it should be an easy fix for
a merge conflict.
