Hi Zi,

Please find the details below. Hope it helps.

Do you have the config file for the CI kernel?
- We are using:
defconfig+https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/tools/testing/selftests/mm/config

And /tmp is also on nfs?
- Yes

Any detailed information about CI machine environment?
- We are running the test using LAVA device Cavium Thunder X2 (TX2),
- We have very similar rootfs as - nfsrootfs:
https://storage.kernelci.org/images/rootfs/debian/bullseye-kselftest/20240129.0/arm64/full.rootfs.tar.xz
- We are using grub boot method over nfs
- Additionally Ryan mentioned "Looks like it is failing because he is
trying to delete the temp dir with rmdir() but rmdir() requires the
directory to be empty, which it is not."

Thanks,
Aishwarya
