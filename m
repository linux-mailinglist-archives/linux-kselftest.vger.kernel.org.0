I'll reply in more detail to some other earlier messages in this thread
later.

This reply is an attempt to return to the intent of my original reply to
patch 0 of this series.

My first reply to patch 0 was in the context of knowing next to nothing
about kselftest.  My level of understanding was essentially from slideware.
(As the thread progressed, I dug a little deeper into kselftest, so now have
a slightly better, though still fairly surface understanding of kselftest).

Maybe I did not explain myself clearly enough in that reply.  I will try
again here.

Patch 0 provided a one paragraph explanation of why KUnit exists, titled

   "## What's so special about unit testing?"

Patch 0 also provided a statement that it is not meant to replace
kselftest, in a paragraph titled

   "## Is KUnit trying to replace other testing frameworks for the kernel?"

I stated:

   "My understanding is that the intent of KUnit is to avoid booting a kernel on
   real hardware or in a virtual machine.  That seems to be a matter of semantics
   to me because isn't invoking a UML Linux just running the Linux kernel in
   a different form of virtualization?

   So I do not understand why KUnit is an improvement over kselftest.

   ...

   What am I missing?"


I was looking for a fuller, better explanation than was given in patch 0
of how KUnit provides something that is different than what kselftest
provides for creating unit tests for kernel code.

New question "(2)":

(2) If KUnit provides something unique, then the obvious follow on
question would be: does it make sense to (a) integrate that feature into
kselftest, (b) integrate the current kselftest in kernel test functionality
into KUnit and convert the in kernel test portion of kselftest to use
KUnit, or (c) KUnit and kselftest are so different that they need to
remain separate features.

*****  Please do not reply to this email with a discussion of "(2)".
*****  Such a discussion is premature if there is not an answer
*****  to my first question.

Observation (3), rephrased:

(3) I also brought up the issue that if option (c) was the answer to
question "(2)" (instead of either option (a) or option (b)) then this
is extra overhead for any developer or maintainer involved in different
subsystems that use the different frameworks.  I intended this as one
possible motivation for why my first question mattered.

Ted grabbed hold of this issue and basically ignored what I intended
to be my core question.  Nobody else has answered my core question,
though Knut's first reply did manage to get somewhere near the
intent of my core question.

*****  Please do not reply to this email with a discussion of "(3)".
*****  Such a discussion is premature if there is not an answer
*****  to my first question.
*****
*****  Also that discussion is already occurring in this thread,
*****  feel free to discuss it there if you want, even though I
*****  feel such discussion is premature.

I still do not have an answer to my original question.
