I really do not follow. If the page is unevictable then why movability
matters? I also fail to see why NR_SLAB is even considered considering
this is completely outside of slab proper.

Really what is the point? What are we trying to achieve by stats? Do we
want to know how much secret memory is used because that is an
interesting/important information or do we just want to make some
accounting?

Just think at it from a practical point of view. I want to know how much
slab memory is used because it can give me an idea whether kernel is
consuming unexpected amount of memory. Now I have to subtract _some_
number to get that information. Where do I get that some number?

We have been creative with counters and it tends to kick back much more
often than it helps.

I really do not want this to turn into an endless bike shed but either
this should be accounted as a general type of memory (unevictable would
be a good fit because that is a userspace memory which is not
reclaimable) or it needs its own counter to tell how much of this
specific type of memory is used for this purpose.
