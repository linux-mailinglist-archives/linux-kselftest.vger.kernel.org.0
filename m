My thought was that if libc knows about shadow stacks, it is probably
going to be built to use them too and so would enable shadow stack
during startup to protect its own code.

(Technically those would be independent decisions, but it seems a good
idea to use a hardening feature if you know about and it is present.)


If so, shadow stacks might always get turned on before the main program
gets a look-in.

Or is that not the expectation?

Do we know if code that actually does that?  IIUC, trying to do this is
totally broken on most arches nowadays; making it work requires a
reentrant C library and/or logic to defer signals around critical
sections in userspace.

"Real" threading makes this pretty pointless for the most part.


Related question: does shadow stack work with ucontext-based coroutines?
Per-context stacks need to be allocated by the program for that.

I'm not sure that we should always put information in the signal frame
that the signal handler can't obtain directly.

I guess it's harmless to include this, though.

I guess we can't really argue that the shadow stack pointer is
redundant here though.  The whole point of shadow stacks is to make
things more robust...

Just kicking the tyres on the question of whether we need it here, but
I guess it's hard to make a good case for saying "no".
