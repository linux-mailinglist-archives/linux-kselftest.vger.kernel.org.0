It defintely works substantially beyond selftests.  For the actual
distros there's definitely interest out there, gated on upstreaming.

Android is the main full userspace that people have been working with,
we've not run into anything ABI related yet that I'm aware of - there is
one thing that's being chased down but we're fairly confident that is a
bug somewhere rather than the ABI being unsuitable.

Right, this is happening but your pushback seemed to be "why would
anyone even consider deploying this?" rather than "could anyone deploy
this?", tests on forks can help a bit with the first question but your
concern seemed more at the level of even getting people to look at the
work rather than just rejecting it out of hand.

I'd say thus far text mode embedded/server type stuff is looking pretty
good, especially for C stuff - setjmp/longjmp and an unwinder cover a
*lot*.  We do need to do more here, especially GUI stuff, but it's
progressing well thus far.

Sure, but we're also in the position where there's only been the very
beginnings of kernel review and obviously that's very important too and
there's often really substantial lead times on that, plus the potential
for need for redoing all the testing if there's issues identified.  I'd
hope to at least be able to get to a point where the major concern
people have is testing.  Another goal here is to feed any concerns we do
have into what's happening with x86 and RISC-V so that we have as much
alignment as possible in how this is supposed to work on Linux, that'll
make everyone's life easier.

In terms of timescales given that users with generic distros are a big
part of the expected audience while we're well in advance of where it's
actually going to be used we do need to be mindful of lead times in
getting support into the software users are likely to want to run so
they've got something they can use when they do get hardware.  We don't
need to rush into anything, but we should probably use that time for
careful consideration.
