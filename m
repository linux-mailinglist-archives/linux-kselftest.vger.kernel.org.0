You're welcome :)

Just a bit of context: I found this problematic pattern in my own 
selftests (rseq and membarrier), and figured that it was an issue all 
across the board. I did an initial single-patch fix, and then split it 
up in 34 patches based on feedback from Shuah Khan.

I know it should have a Fixed ... tag, but I simply don't have time to 
do the historical investigation work for all the 34 patches form this 
patchset. Perhaps someone else is up to the task ?

If this can be automated, then perhaps Shuah can use it to append the 
relevant information ?

Yes, this should perhaps come as additional fixes on top of my series. I 
don't have time to do it myself though.

Anyone willing to contribute it ?

Yes, I did likewise.

Thanks for the feedback,
