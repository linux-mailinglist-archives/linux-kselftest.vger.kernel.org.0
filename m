Heh, heh. That's actually the way I had it in the earliest versions of
KUnit! But that was pretty much the very first thing everyone
complained about. I think I went from no prefix (like you are
suggesting) to TEST_* before the first version of the RFC at the
request of several people I was kicking the idea around with, and then
I think I was asked to go from TEST_* to KUNIT_* in the very first
revision of the RFC.

In short, I am sympathetic to your suggestion, but I think that is
non-negotiable at this point. The community has a clear policy in
place on the matter, and at this point I would really prefer not to
change all the symbol names again.

You mean the Googletest/Googlemock expectations/assertions?

It's a great library (with not so great a name), but unfortunately it
is written in C++, which I think pretty much counts it out here.

I think that would be cool, but again, I don't think this will be
possible with Googletest/Googlemock.

I am glad you think so!

If your biggest concern on my side is test macro names (which I think
is a no-go as I mentioned above), I think we should be in pretty good
shape once you are ready to move forward. Besides, I have a lot more
KUnit patches coming after this: landing this patchset is just the
beginning. So how about we keep moving forward on this patchset?
