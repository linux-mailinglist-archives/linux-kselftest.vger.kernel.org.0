It would be convenient for that "gfp =" code to work, as this would
allow better cache locality while invoking RCU callbacks, and would
further provide better robustness to callback floods.  The full story
is quite long, but here are alternatives have not yet been proven to be
abject failures:

1.	Use workqueues to do the allocations in a clean context.
	While waiting for the allocations, the callbacks are queued
	in the old cache-busting manner.  This functions correctly,
	but in the meantime (which on busy systems can be some time)
	the cache locality and robustness are lost.

2.	Provide the ability to allocate memory in raw atomic context.
	This is extremely effective, especially when used in combination
	with #1 above, but as you might suspect, the MM guys don't like
	it much.

In contrast, with Thomas's patch series, call_rcu() and kvfree_rcu()
could just look at preemptible() to see whether or not it was safe to
allocate memory, even in !PREEMPT kernels -- and in the common case,
it almost always would be safe.  It is quite possible that this approach
would work in isolation, or failing that, that adding #1 above would do
the trick.

I understand that this is all very hand-wavy, and I do apologize for that.
If you really want the full sad story with performance numbers and the
works, let me know!

							Thanx, Paul
