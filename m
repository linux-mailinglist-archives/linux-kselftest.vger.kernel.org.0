Hi Szabolcs,

Good point. Could you please propose a wording that would be suitable for this case?

I used sbrk(0) with the meaning of "end of the process's data segment" not
implying that this is a syscall, but just as a useful way to identify the mapping.
I agree that it is a posix function implemented by libc but when it is used with
0 finds the current location of the program break, which can be changed by brk()
and depending on the new address passed to this syscall can have the effect of
allocating or deallocating memory.

Will changing sbrk(0) with "end of the process's data segment" make it more clear?

I will add what you are suggesting about the heap area.
