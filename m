And the ppoll() argument cleanup (10) for that matter.

Zhangjin:

IMO it would be more convenient to move generic cleanup patches to the
beginning of the series.
When the reviewers are focussing on the real changes they won't be
interrupted by the cleanups. Also the maintainer can more easily pick
them up independently, so they are dealt with and nobody has to worry
about them anymore.
