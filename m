printk has this same requirement for its CONT messages. You can read
about how I propose to implement that here[0], using a separate prb
ringbuffer for buffered storage until all the pieces are available.

It is not my goal that multiple subsystems start making use of the prb
ringbuffer. However, its features can be attractive if you don't want to
worry about multiple writers/readers or context (including NMI). Before
writing "yet another ringbuffer" [1] it might be worth the effort to at
least see if one of the existing implementations can work (or be
extended to work) for you.
