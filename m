Hi Ted,

I'll try answering this again.

The first time I was a little flippant in part of my answer because I
thought your comments somewhat flippant.  This time I'll provide a
more complete answer.

My flippant answer:

This time:

My reply to Greg was pointing out that in-kernel tests do exist in
kselftest.

Your comment that the majority of kselftests are implemented as userspace
programs has no bearing on whether kselftest support in-kernel tests.
It does not counter the fact the kselftest supports in-kernel tests.

The kselftest in-kernel tests follow a common pattern.  As such, there
is a framework.

My flippant answer:

> More specious arguments.

This time:

I took your answer as a straw man, and had no desire to spend time
countering a straw man.

I am not proposing using a vice grips (to use your analogy).  I
am saying that maybe the monkey wrench already exists.

My point of this whole thread has been to try to get the submitter
to provide a better, more complete explanation of how and why KUnit 
is a better tool.

I have not yet objected to the number (and differences among) the
many sub-system tests.  I am questioning whether there is a need
for another _test framework_ for in-kernel testing.  If there is
something important that KUnit provides that does not exist in
existing frameworks then the next question would be to ask how
to implement that important thing (improve the existing
framework, replace the existing framework, or have two
frameworks).  I still think it is premature to ask this
question until we first know the answer to what unique features
KUnit adds (and apparently until we know what the existing
framework provides).
