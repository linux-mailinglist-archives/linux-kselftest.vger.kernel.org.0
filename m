Agreed. I understand that this FAQ probably was needed at one time and
Brendan added it to address the concerns.

I think at some point we do need to have a document that outlines when
to KUnit and when to use Kselftest modules. I think one concern people
have is that if KUnit is perceived as a  replacement for Ksefltest
module, Kselftest module will be ignored leaving users without the
ability to build and run with Kselftest modules and load them on a need
basis to gather data on a systems that aren't dedicated strictly for
testing.

I am trying to move the conversation forward from KUnit vs. Kselftest
modules discussion to which problem areas each one addresses keeping
in mind that it is not about which is better. Kselftest and KUnit both
have their place in the kernel development process. We just have to be
clear on usage as we write tests for each.

thanks,
