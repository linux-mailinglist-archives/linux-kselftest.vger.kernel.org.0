Not a bug, just over excessive harassing of the interface,
which can be easily be avoided.

It's already passed inside the queue.

netdev_rx_queue_restart() {
	if (rxq->mp_params && !rxq->netiov_supported)
		fail;
}

You can apply the same argument to anything, but not like
after each for example ->ndo_start_xmit we dig into the
interface's pending queue to make sure it was actually queued.

And even if you check that there is a page pool, the driver
can just create an empty pool that it'll never use. There
are always ways to make it wrong.

Yes, there is a difference, and I'm not against it as a
WARN_ON_ONCE after failing it in a more explicit way.

Jakub might have a different opinion on how it should look
like, and we can clarify on that, but I do believe it's a
confusing interface that can be easily made better.

Right, 10 lines of some odd code, which not even clear off the
bat why it's there if we get an error code from the restart /
callbacks, vs one line of "boilerplate" per driver a la

rxq->netiov_supported = true;

that can be added while implementing the queue api. If it's
missing the user gets back not a subtle error.

That's the thing, I doubt about the second part.

net_devmem_bind_dmabuf_to_queue() {
	err = xa_alloc(&binding->bound_rxqs, &xa_idx, rxq);
	if (err)
		return err;

	netdev_rx_queue_restart();

	// page_pool_check_memory_provider
	...
	xa_for_each(&binding->bound_rxqs, xa_idx, binding_rxq) {
		if (rxq == binding_rxq)
			return success;
}

Can't b4 the patches for some reason, but that's the highlight
from the patchset, correct me if I'm wrong. That xa_for_each
check is always true because you put the queue in there right
before it, and I don't that anyone could've erased it.

The problem here is that it seems the ->bound_rxqs state doesn't
depend on what page pools were actually created and with what mp.

So if you try to add a binding to 2 queues of the same interface,
the first succeeds and the second silently fails, then the
following net_devmem_bind_dmabuf_to_queue() for the second queue
will say that everything is fine, because there is a pool for
the first queue with the binding and the queue check is just
true.

I'll leave that for Jakub to answer

Doable, since it wouldn't change the user api, but that means
refactoring millions drivers (ok, ok, 4-5) instead of preparing
for it from the beginning.

Which is fine, it'd just fail, how are we going to attach to a
queue that hasn't been initialised by the driver yet. Regardless,
I doubt we expose the interface before the driver has a chance
to init it, but I'd need to look it up (or defer to Jakub) to
say for sure.
