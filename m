I don't worry too much on "consistency", but I'm trying to understand
whether it's more beneficial to combine it with uffd or being generic.

One thing I was thinking is if I have a library that manages some memory
for the user, the library can use such madvise()/... to poison specific
small pages (without registering uffd with sigbus mode, also no lose on
page faults of other normal pages) so when illegal access it can trap it
for current mm rather than silently happen (e.g. use after free).  Unpoison
is also easy there, we can simply DONTNEED it.

One defect of such general solution for your case is we need one more
UFFDIO_WAKE, but since we're talking about real poisoned pages on src, so I
guess it's not a concern (unlike most of the rest ioctls).

I've no strong opinion if you still want to do that with an userfault
ioctl.  After all, I can't provide a solid example but just some rough
ideas.  But I hope I explained why I think it's still different from other
ioctls (e.g., an "atomic update a page" operation doesn't sound reasonable
at all as generic operation for any !uffd context, so that definitely
suites more as an uffd specific ioctl).

If with uffd, perhaps avoid calling it sigbus? As we have FEATURE_SIGBUS
and I'm afraid it'll cause confusion.  UFFDIO_HWPOISON may sound more
suitable?

Thanks,
