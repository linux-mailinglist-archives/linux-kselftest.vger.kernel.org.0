Ah, I thought that because they started with "eventfs_" that they were used
for some fops pointer. Note, I try to avoid using the "eventfs_" naming for
static functions that are not exported elsewhere.

We can find a way to make the lock for the root later. Let's get it working
first before we optimize it. I do not want to expose any locking to the
users of this interface.

Yeah, claws-mail has an issue with some emails with quotes in it (sometimes
drops the second quote). Sad part is, it happens after I hit send, and it
is not part of the email. I'll send this reply now, but I bet it's going to happen again.

Let's see :-/  I checked the To and Cc's and they all have the proper
quotes. Let's see what ends up in my "Sent" folder.
