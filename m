Regarding the landlock_release_inodes(), the final wait_var_event() is
indeed needed (as does fsnotify), but why do you use a READ_ONCE() for
landlock_initialized?

I was reluctant to use function pointers but landlock_object_operations
makes a cleaner and more generic interface to manage objects.

Your get_inode_object() is much simpler and easier to understand than
the get_object() and get_cleaner().
The other main change is about the object cross-reference: you entirely
removed it, which means that an object will only be free when there are
no rules using it. This does not free an object when its underlying
object is being terminated. We now only have to worry about the
termination of the parent of an underlying object (e.g. the super-block
of an inode).

However, I think you forgot to increment object->usage in
create_ruleset_elem(). There is also an unused checked_mask variable in
merge_ruleset().

All this removes optimizations that made the code more difficult to
understand. The performance difference is negligible, and I think that
the memory footprint is fine.
These optimizations (and others) could be discussed later. I'm
integrating most of your changes in the next patch series.

Thank you very much for this review and the code.

Good catch.

Yes, let's go for immutable domains.

Definitely. This was a previous (private) implementation I did for
domains, but to simplify the code I reused the same type as a ruleset. A
future evolution of Landlock could add back this optimization.

Right, much better with that.

There is an additionnal check in syscall.c:get_path_from_fd(): it is
forbidden to add a rule with a path which is not accessible (according
to LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_OPEN) thanks to a call to security_file_open(),
but this is definitely not perfect.

I would prefer to add the same checks you described at first (with
check_access_path), but only when creating a new ruleset with
merge_ruleset() (which should probably be renamed). This enables not to
rely on a parent ruleset/domain until the enforcement, which is the case
anyway.
Unfortunately this doesn't work for some cases with bind mounts. Because
check_access_path() goes through one path, another (bind mounted) path
could be illegitimately allowed.
That makes the problem a bit more complicated. A solution may be to keep
track of the hierarchy of each rule (e.g. with a layer/depth number),
and only allow an access request if at least a rule of each layer allow
this access. In this case we also need to correctly handle the case when
rules from different layers are tied to the same object.

I would like Landlock to have "pure" syscalls, in the sense that a
process A (e.g. a daemon) could prepare a ruleset and sends its FD to a
process B which would then be able to use it to sandbox itself. I think
it makes the reasoning clearer not to have a given ruleset (FD) tied to
a domain (i.e. parent ruleset) at first.
Landlock should (as much as possible) return an error if a syscall
argument is invalid, not according to the current access control (which
is not the case currently because of the security_file_open() check).
This means that these additional merge_ruleset() checks should only
affect the new domain/ruleset, but it should not be visible to userspace.

In a future evolution, it may be useful to add a lock/seal command to
deny any additional rule enforcement. However that may be
counter-productive because that enable application developers (e.g. for
a shell) to deny the use of Landlock features to its child processes.
But it would be possible anyway with seccomp-bpf…
