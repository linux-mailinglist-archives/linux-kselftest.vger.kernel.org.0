Agreed. In this context, KASAN is essentially a different implementation of the
same checks that SLUB_DEBUG offers (and also does other checks) and we excercise
these SLUB_DEBUG checks by deliberately causing the corruption that they detect
- so instead, KASAN detects it, as it should. I assume that once somebody opts
for a full KASAN kernel build, they don't need the SLUB_DEBUG functionality at
that point, as KASAN is more extensive (On the other hand SLUB_DEBUG kernels can
be (and are) shipped as production distro kernels where specific targetted
debugging can be enabled to help find bugs in production with minimal disruption).
So trying to make both cooperate can work only to some extent and for now we've
chosen the safer way.
