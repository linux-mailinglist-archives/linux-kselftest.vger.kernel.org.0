I'm happy with the ABI overall, but I think we need a few more tweaks.

As I commented on v2, the "i.e." is not correct: these 3 sections are not the only 
ones that are covered by this ABI (.text also is, for instance). Replacing "i.e." 
with "e.g." would work.

Also, since the rules above say explicitly "done by the process itself", it might be 
clearer to replace "following the restrictions presented above" with "with the same 
restrictions as for mmap()".

I find this very confusing, because it suggests that the default value of 
PR_GET_TAGGED_ADDR_CTRL for new processes will be set to the value of this sysctl, 
when in fact this sysctl is about restricting the *availability* of the new ABI. 
Instead of disabling the ABI, I would talk about disabling access to the new ABI here.

Have we definitely decided that arg{3,4,5} are ignored? Catalin?

I think this is too vague, you can use this prctl() to disable the new ABI, and it 
can also fail. Maybe it's best to simply say that the process has successfully opted 
into the new ABI.

"pointer". Also, is it really useful to talk about newly introduced syscall? New from

prctl_set_mm() and prctl_set_mm_map() are internal kernel functions, not syscall 
names. IIUC, we don't want to allow any address field settable via the PR_SET_MM 
prctl() to be tagged. Catalin, is that correct? I think this needs rephrasing.
