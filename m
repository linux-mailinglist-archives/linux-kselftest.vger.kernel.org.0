Allowing direct transition from member to invalid partition doesn't feel 
right for me. A casual user may assume a partition is correctly formed 
without double checking the "cpuset.partition" value. Returning an error 
will prevent this kind of issue. If returning more information about the 
failure is the main reason for allowing the invalid partition 
transition, we can extend the "cpuset.partition" read syntax to also 
show the reason for the previous failure.

Cheers,
