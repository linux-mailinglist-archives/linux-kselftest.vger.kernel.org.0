Yeah and I unfortunately ignored all of them.

It would be good if someone provided a summary of the x86 decision (I'll
get to those thread but most likely in September). I think we concluded
that we can't deploy GCS entirely transparently, so we need a libc
change (apart from the ELF annotations). Since libc is opting in to GCS,
we could also update the pthread_create() etc. to allocate the shadow
together with the standard stack.

Anyway, that's my preference but maybe there were good reasons not to do
this.
