Right, something in the kernel should take care of it. You temporarily
attach it to the socket, which is fine. And you could've also stored
it in the netlink socket or some other object. In case of zcrx io_uring
impl, it's bound to io_uring, io_uring is responsible for cleaning them
up. And we do it before __page_pool_destroy, otherwise there would be
a ref dependency.

A side note, attaching to netlink or some other global object sounds
conceptually better, as once you return a buffer to the user, the
socket should not have any further business with the buffer. FWIW,
that better resembles io_uring approach. For example allows to:

recv(sock);
close(sock);
process_rx_buffers();

or to return (i.e. DEVMEM_DONTNEED) buffers from different sockets
in one call. However, I don't think it's important for devmem and
perhaps more implementation dictated.

By "would leak" you probably mean until step 6, right? There are
always many ways to shoot yourself in the leg. Even if you clean
up in 5, the user can just leak the socket and get the same result
with pp starvation. I see it not as a requirement but rather a
uapi choice, that's assuming netlink would be cleaned as a normal
socket when the task exits.

Surely we don't, but it's still the user's responsibility to
return buffers back. And in case of io_uring buffers returned
to the user are not attached to a socket, so even the
scope / lifetime is a bit different.

Completely agree with you, which is why it was in a callback,
totally controlled by io_uring.
