Unfortunately, as I explain below, it is a bit tricky.

Right.

That is not correct. When there is no more process enforced by a
domain/ruleset, this domain is terminated, which means that every rules
linked to this domain are put away. When the usage counter of a rule
reaches zero, then the rule is terminated with landlock_put_rule() which
unlink the rule from its object and clean this object. The cleaning
involves to free the object if there is no rule tied to this object,
thanks to put_object_cleaner().

When the underlying object is terminated, landlock_release_object() also
decrement the usage counter. However, if there is a concurrent thread
adding a new rule, the usage counter still stay greater than zero while
the new rule is being added, but the counter then drops to zero at the
end of this addition, which can then unbalance the "cleaners" counter,
which will finally leads to the object freeing. This design enables to
add rules without locking (if the object already exists). While this
property is interesting for a performance point of view, the main reason
is to avoid unnecessary lock between processes (especially from
different domains).

That is true for now, but only because I didn't find yet the right spot
to call landlock_release_inode(). Indeed, unlinking a file may not
terminate an inode because it can still be open by a process, and
freeing an object when the underlying object is unlinked could be a way
to bypass a check on that object/inode.

Do you know where is the best spot to identify the last userspace
reference (through the filesystem or a file descriptor) to an inode?
Fnotify doesn't seem to check for that.

We need to increment the reference counter of the underlying objects
(i.e. inodes) not to lose the link with their Landlock object and then
the related access-control. For instance, if a struct inode (e.g. a
directory) is first tied to a Landlock object/access-control, then
because the inode is not open nor used by any process and the kernel
decides to free it, when a process tries to access a file beneath this
directory, there will not have any Landlock object tied to it and the
requested access might then be forbidden (whereas the initial policy
allowed it).

Before the current design, I used a similar pattern, but this is not
necessary because of the management of the underlying object lifetime.
The list_empty() check is enough, and because we need to handle
concurrent termination, the object's usage counter for the rules seems
unnecessary.

In the case of Landlock, it is illegal to use or recycle a rule which
was untied from its (initial) object. There is no use of
list_empty(&landlock_rule->list), only
landlock_rule_is_disabled(landlock_rule). The LIST_POISON2 might help to
identify such misuse.
