I am fine with the above.  This basically removes the special case of
"attribute", and what we have been calling attributes are now metadata,
just like any other metadata.

That is the way I would expect metadata to exist.  I think I had implicitly
expected test metadata and suite metadata to be of the same format.

It seems to me that "suite" is more a kunit concept than a KTAP concept.
The kunit suite naturally maps into the top level KTAP test, but I don't
think that KTAP should use the term "suite".

Sounds good to me.
