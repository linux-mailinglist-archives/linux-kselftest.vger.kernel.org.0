Looking at your keys subsystem based PoC (thanks for putting it
together), I understand that the intention is to pass an attestation
evidence request as a payload to the kernel, in a abstract way.
i.e. the void *data in:
static int guest_attest_request_key(struct key *authkey, void *data)

And then passiing that down to vendor specific handlers
(tdx_request_attest in your PoC) for it to behave as a key server for
that attestation evidence request. The vendor magic of transforming an
attestation request into an actual attestation evidence (typically
signed with platform derived keys) is stuffed into that handler. The
format, content and protection of both the attestation evidence request
and the evidence itself is left for the guest kernel handler (e.g.
tdx_request_attest) to handle.

Is that a fair description of your proposal?

If it is, then it makes sense to me, and could serve as a generic
abstraction for confidential computing guest attestation evidence
requests. I think it could support the TDX, SEV and also the RISC-V
(aka CoVE) guest attestation request evidence flow.

I'm not sure which signature we're talking about here.
The final attestation evidence (The blob the guest workload will send to
a remote attestation service) is signed with a platform derived key,
typically rooted into a manufacturer's CA. It is then up to the *remote*
attestation service to authenticate and validate the evidence signature.
Then it can go through the actual attestation verification flow
(comparison against reference values, policy checks, etc). The latter
should be none of the guest kernel's business, which is what your
proposal seems to be heading to.

Your vendor specific key handler may have to decode the passed void
pointer into a vendor specific structure before sending it down to the
TSM/ASP/etc, and that's fine imho.

Cheers,
Samuel.
