Why shouldn't we ? We have enough precedents where driver authors rushed
to adopt brand new APIs without understand the implications.
devm_kzalloc() is a prime example of a small new API that very quickly
got misused everywhere. If we had taken the time to clearly explain when
it should be used and when it should *not* be used, we wouldn't be
plagued by as many device removal race conditions today. Let's not
repeat the same mistake, I'd like this new API to make things better,
not worse.

I'm looking forward to that. Please let me know if there's anything you
would like to discuss. I didn't dive deep in technical details in this
thread, and I don't expect anyone to guess what I have in mind if I
failed to express it :-) I'm very confident the cdev race condition can
be fixed in a neat way, so let's do that.
