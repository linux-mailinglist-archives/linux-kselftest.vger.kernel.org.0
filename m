IMHO snapshots may not need a log at all - it needs CoW before the write
happens.  Nor is the case for swapping with userfaults, IIUC.  IOW in those
cases people don't care which page got dirtied, but care on data not being
modified until the app allows it to.

But I get the point, and I agree collecting by scanning is slower.

Feel free to ignore this part if we're not taking about using a ring
structure.  My previous comment was mostly for that.  Bitmaps won't have
this issue.  Here I see a bitmap as one way to implement a log, where it's
recorded by one bit per page.  My comment was that we should be careful on
using rings.

Side note: actually kvm dirty ring is even trickier; see the soft-full
(kvm_dirty_ring.soft_limit) besides the hard-full event to make sure
hard-full won't really trigger (or we're prone to lose dirty bits).  I
don't think we'll have the same issue here so we can trigger hard-full, but
it's still unwanted to halt the threads being tracked for dirty pages.  I
don't know whether there'll be other side effects by the ring, though..

Yes I also don't know..  As I mentioned I'm not super happy with the
interface either, but that's the simplest I can think of so far.

IOW, from an "userfaultfd-side reviewer" POV I'm fine if someone wants to
leverage the concepts of uffd-wp and its internals using a separate but
very light weighted patch just to impl async mode of uffd-wp.  But I'm
always open to any suggestions too.  It's just that when there're multiple
options and when we're not confident on either way, I normally prefer the
simplest and cleanest (even if less efficient).

Note that I think what Muhammad (sorry, Muhammad! I think I spelled your
name wrongly before starting from some email..) proposed is not a bitmap,
but an array of ranges that can coalesce the result into very condensed
form.  Pros and cons.

Again, I can't comment much on that API, but since there're a bunch of
other developers looking at that and they're also potential future users,
I'll trust their judgement and just focus more on the other side of things.

Thanks,
