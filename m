I have to confess that I inherited this from the x86 code and never
thought too hard about it.  I've got a horrible feeling the reasoning is
simply the way in which x86 fits shadow stack into the page tables
without having a mechanism like permission indirection, these don't
apply for us.

It's more that there are security concerns with having PROT_, especially
in conjunction with needing to provide a token for stack pivot - we not
only need to map pages for the GCS, we also need to write a cap token
into it so that we can pivot to the new stack.  If the GCS can ever be
written to by userspace via normal means then that's an issue for the
basic protection model that the feature is trying to implement.  If we
have the PROT_ but try to check for bad uses of it that makes everything
messy and complicated which is especially non-ideal for a feature with a
security focus.  Having a more packaged system call is easier for
everyone.

More detail in the x86 patch that's currently in -next:

I've updated it.

Yes, pushing should be fine just as for the regular stack.

That's the only place.  I've moved the above check into copy_thread_gcs(),
you're right that the other checks are redundant as they're done in the
caller already.
