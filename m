I really do not think the overall usage matters when it comes to abusing
other counters. Changing this in future will be always tricky and there
always be our favorite "Can this break userspace" question. Yes we dared
to change meaning of some counters but this is not generally possible.
Just have a look how accounting shmem as a page cache has turned out
being much more tricky than many like.

Really if a separate counter is a big deal, for which I do not see any
big reason, then this should be accounted as unevictable (as suggested
by Matthew) and ideally pages of those mappings should be sitting in the
unevictable LRU as well unless there is a strong reason against.
