Yes that is exactly what we do. kselftest build depends on headers
install. The way it works for qemu is either using vitme-ng or
building tests and installing them in your vm.. This is what CIs do.

This is what CIs do. Yes - it works for them to build and install
headers. You don't have to install them on the build system. You
run "make headers" in your repo. You could use O= option for
relocatable build.

Some of these defines were added a while back. Often these defines
need cleaning up. I would rather not see new ones added unless it is
absolutely necessary.

Does this test really need fcntl.h is another question.
This is another problem with too many includes. The test
built just fine on my system on 6.12-rc3 with

+/* #include <fcntl.h> */

If these defines are in a header file - tests include them. Part
of test development is figuring out these problems.

I would like us to explore before giving up and saying these will
stay.
