Hi Liam,

Thanks for the feedback and for extending the list.

Thanks for bringing that up.  The document mostly contains the decision 
itself.  The main alternative considered previously was a temporary 
reintroduction of the pages to the direct map whenever a KVM-internal 
access is required.  It was coming with a significant complexity of 
guaranteeing correctness in all cases [1].  Since the memslot structure 
already contains a guest memory pointer supplied by the userspace, KVM 
can use it directly when in the VMM or vCPU context.  I will add this in 
the cover for the next version.

AFAIK the lockdep issue was reported on a v7 of a different change.
I'm basing my series on [2] ("KVM: Mapping guest_memfd backed memory at 
the host for software protected VMs"), while the issue was reported on 
[2] ("KVM: Restricted mapping of guest_memfd at the host and arm64 
support"), which is also built on top of [2].  Please correct me if I'm 
missing something.

The key feature that is required by my series is the ability to mmap 
guest_memfd when the VM type allows.  My understanding is no-one is 
opposed to that as of now, that's why I assumed it's safe to build on 
top of that.
