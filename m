Heh, yes. :)

    clone.2: Allocate child's stack using mmap(2) rather than malloc(3)

    Christian Brauner suggested mmap(MAP_STACKED), rather than
    malloc(), as the canonical way of allocating a stack for the
    child of clone(), and Jann Horn noted some reasons why:

        Not on Linux, but on OpenBSD, they do use MAP_STACK now
        AFAIK; this was announced here:
        <http://openbsd-archive.7691.n7.nabble.com/stack-register-checking-td338238.html>.
        Basically they periodically check whether the userspace
        stack pointer points into a MAP_STACK region, and if not,
        they kill the process. So even if it's a no-op on Linux, it
        might make sense to advise people to use the flag to improve
        portability? I'm not sure if that's something that belongs
        in Linux manpages.

        Another reason against malloc() is that when setting up
        thread stacks in proper, reliable software, you'll probably
        want to place a guard page (in other words, a 4K PROT_NONE
        VMA) at the bottom of the stack to reliably catch stack
        overflows; and you probably don't want to do that with
        malloc, in particular with non-page-aligned allocations.

    And the OpenBSD 6.5 manual pages says:

        MAP_STACK
            Indicate that the mapping is used as a stack. This
            flag must be used in combination with MAP_ANON and
            MAP_PRIVATE.

    And I then noticed that MAP_STACK seems already to be on
    FreeBSD for a long time:

        MAP_STACK
            Map the area as a stack.  MAP_ANON is implied.
            Offset should be 0, fd must be -1, and prot should
            include at least PROT_READ and PROT_WRITE.  This
            option creates a memory region that grows to at
            most len bytes in size, starting from the stack
            top and growing down.  The stack top is the start‚Äê
            ing address returned by the call, plus len bytes.
            The bottom of the stack at maximum growth is the
            starting address returned by the call.

            The entire area is reserved from the point of view
            of other mmap() calls, even if not faulted in yet.

Yeah, stack handling - especially with legacy clone() - is yucky on the
best of days. Thank you for the fix.
