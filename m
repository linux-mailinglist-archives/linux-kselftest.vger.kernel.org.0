Lock is taken and we check if pmd has UFFD_WP set or not. In the next
version, the GET check has been removed as we have dropped WP_ENGAGE + !GET
operation. So get is always specified and condition isn't needed.

Please comment on next version if you want anything more optimized.

[A] Do you think these names would work better: PM_SCAN_WRITTEN_PAGE,
PM_SCAN_FILE_PAGE, PM_SCAN_SWAP_PAGE, PM_SCAN_PRESENT_PAGE?

The PAGEMAP_SCAN ioctl is working on page granularity level. We tell the
user if a page has certain flags are not. Keeping length in bytes doesn't
makes sense.
