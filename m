This simple interface is good only for a limited number of use-cases.
The interface
that I suggest doesn't duplicate more code than this one, but it is much more
universal. It will be a big mess if you add a separate API for each
specific use-case.

This is a good example. If we expect more than two consequent pages
on average, the "region" interface looks more prefered. I don't know your
use-case, but in the case of CRIU, this assumption looks reasonable.

Now, it is more clear where this interface came from. It repeats the interface
of Windows' getWriteWatch. I think we have to look wider. The
interface that reports
regions will be more efficient for many use-cases. As for
getWriteWatch, it will require
a bit more code in user-space, but this code is trivial.

Thanks,
Andrei
