And that is after years of cleanup on my part. Try going back to v4.1
for instance, check the code out then for an incredible horrific sight :)

I'm in total agreement! I *know* there must be holes in that code, and I
acknowledge a few possible gotchas on the commit logs. For instance, I
acknowledged that the firmware cache had a secondary purpose which was
not well documented or understood through commit e44565f62a720
("firmware: fix batched requests - wake all waiters"). The firmware
cache allows for batching requests and sharing the same original request
for multiple consecutive requests which *race against each other*.
That's when I started having my doubts about the architecture of the
firmware cache mechanism, it seemed too complex and perhaps overkill
and considered killing it.

As I noted in that commit, the firmware cache is used for:
    
1) Addressing races with file lookups during the suspend/resume cycle by
keeping firmware in memory during the suspend/resume cycle
	           
2) Batched requests for the same file rely only on work from the first
file lookup, which keeps the firmware in memory until the last
release_firmware() is called

Also worth quoting from that commit as well:

"Batched requests *only* take effect if secondary requests come in
prior to the first user calling release_firmware(). The devres name used
for the internal firmware cache is used as a hint other pending requests
are ongoing, the firmware buffer data is kept in memory until the last
user of the buffer calls release_firmware(), therefore serializing
requests and delaying the release until all requests are done."

Later we discovered that the firmware cache had a serious security issue
since its inception through commit 422b3db2a503 ("firmware: Fix security
issue with request_firmware_into_buf()"). Granted, exploiting this would
require the ability to load kernel code, so the vector of exploitation
is rather small.

The cache stuff cannot be removed as it *at least* resolves the fw
suspend stuff, but still, this can likely use a revisit in rachitecture
long term. The second implicit use case for batched requests however
seems complex and not sure if its worth to maintain. I'll note that
at least some drivers *do* their own firmware caching, iwlwifi, is one,
so there is an example there to allow drivers to say "I actually don't
need caching" for the future.

If you're volunteering to cleaning / testing the cache stuff I highly
welcome that. That and the fallback stuff has been needing testing for
years. Someoone was working on patches on the test case for cache stuff
a while ago, from Intel, but they disappeared.

I missed that sorry.

Alright, I'll dig in and take a look, and propose an alternative.

That is nothing compared to the amount of fixes I have found and
actually fixed too, the code was a nightmare before I took on
maintenance.

Alright, I'll go try to fix this. Thanks for the report.

I hinted in my review of the oops what the issue was.

Cool, is the driver upstream?

Makes perfect sense considering the lack of testing I noted.

That's because of batched firmware request mechanism.

I will take a look at this now.

No, that is not sufficient, although it would also solve the
issue.

No, you are incorrect. The other firmware API calls *have* been
elaborately tested. The firmware cache stuff *is a mess* however,
since we *use and support it*, I've done my best to salvage it and
document it.

I'll take a look at this and propose an alternative solution.
