You're quite right -- the codepath I was worried about was pick_link()
failing (which *does* clear nd->path.mnt, and I must've misread it at
the time as nd->root.mnt).

We can drop this check, though now complete_walk()'s main defence
against a NULL nd->root.mnt is that path_is_under() will fail and
trigger -EXDEV (or set_root() will fail at some point in the future).
However, as you pointed out, a NULL nd->root.mnt won't happen with
things as they stand today -- I might be a little too paranoid. :P

Yup -- see above, the worry was about pick_link() not about how the
RCU-walk and REF-walk dances operate.

You're quite right about dropping the legitimize_root() check, but I'd
like to keep the WARN_ON() in set_root(). The main reason being that it
makes us very damn sure that a future change won't accidentally break
the nd->root contract which all of the LOOKUP_IS_SCOPED changes rely on.
Then again, this might be my paranoia popping up again.

If you feel that dropping some of these more defensive checks is better
for the codebase as a whole, then I defer to your judgement. I
completely agree that namei is a pretty complicated chunk of code.
