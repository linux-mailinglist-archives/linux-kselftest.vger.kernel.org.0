MADV_HWPOISON really is the wrong interface to use. See "man madvise".

We don't want to allow arbitrary users to hwpoison+offline absolutely 
healthy physical memory, which is what MADV_HWPOISON is all about.

As you say, we want to turn an unpopulated (!present) virtual address to 
mimic like we had a MCE on a page that would have been previously mapped 
here: install a hwpoison marker without actually poisoning any present 
page. In fact, we'd even want to fail if there *is* something mapped.

Sure, one could teach MADV_HWPOISON to allow unprivileged users to do 
that for !present PTE entries, and fail for unprivileged users if there 
is a present PTE entry. I'm not sure if that's the cleanest approach, 
though, and a new MADV as suggested in this thread would eventually be 
cleaner.
