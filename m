You recall right.
I wanted us to work together to refine a common approach.
I still think that's possible.

I believe there's overlap and potential for unification and code sharing.
My concern is to make sure that that can happen without disrupting too 
many test users. I'd really like to get some more time to explore that.

It strikes me that the main difference in the two approaches 
lies in the way reporting is done by default. Since KUnit handles all the
reporting itself, while KTF relies on Googletest for that, a lot more code 
in KUnit revolves around that part, while with KTF we have focused more on 
features to enable writing powerful and effective tests.

The reporting part can possibly be made configurable: Reporting with printk or reporting 
via netlink to user space. In fact, as a KTF debugging option KTF already 
supports printk reporting which can be enabled via sysfs.

If macros can have the same syntax, then there's 
likely features in KTF that KUnit users would benefit from too. 
But this of course have to be tried out.
