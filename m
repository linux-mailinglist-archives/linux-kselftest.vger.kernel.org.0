As I explained wrt. shell's trap, this issue won't be avoided from
userspace because trap function can be terminated by ctrl-c too,
otherwise one shell script may not be terminated at all.

The unclean shutdown can be observed in single 'while true; do zram02.sh; done'
too on both your patches and mine.

Also it is insane to write write test in a deadloop, and people seldom
do that, not see such way in either blktests/xfstests.

I you limit completion time of this test in long enough time(one or
several hours) or big enough loops, I believe it can be done cleanly,
such as:

cnt=0
MAX=10000
while [ $cnt -lt $MAX ]; do
	PATH=$PATH:$PWD:$PWD/../../../lib/ ./zram02.sh;
done


Thanks,
Ming
