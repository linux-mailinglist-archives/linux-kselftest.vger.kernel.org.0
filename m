Sure.

Backing out is easier to do for hugepages. But for normal pages, we'll have
to write some code to find where the current data was added (in cur or in
vec) and back out from that. I'll have to write some more code to avoid the
side-effects as well.

But aren't we going over-engineering here? Error occurred and we are trying
to keep the previously generated correct data and returning successfully
still to the user? I don't think we should do this. An error is error. We
should return the error simply even if the memory flags would get lost. We
don't know what caused the error in uffd_wp_range(). Under normal
situation, we there shouldn't have had error.
