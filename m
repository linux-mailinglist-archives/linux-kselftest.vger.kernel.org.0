The difference at the call site will be function call vs field access.
Do you mean that moving the function to where the struct is
initialized would add complexity? Why is that?

My point is that you need to split the THP only if doing a GET+WP
operation. If you only do GET, then the worst case would be for the
process to report a spurious WRITTEN bit if an earlier-visited part of
THP was modified and the scan restarted in the middle of a THP.

Ah, I was thinking about calling pagemap_scan_output() before checking
split_huge_pmd() case - and at that use the pagemap_scan_output()'s
return value to do the check.

Ok, so the PTE case could use a flag recording whether any PTE had WP
applied instead of `is_written`.

Those two cases can be differentiated when checked before truncating
n_pages. If a user requests partial WP for a hugetlb page wouldn't
EINVAL (or other error - as this can't ever work) be more appropriate
(this check could happen only at the start of scan)? If the request is
due to max_pages limit (with found_pages > 0), then I'd return ENOSPC
and expect the user to restart the scan with a new buffer.

Our discussion here makes me wonder: what is the expected return value
for the ioctl WP (without GET) operation? If it would return e.g. the
number of 4K-pages successfully scanned, then the caller would be able
to detect the partial tail hugepage case and act accordingly.

The difference is that you have the subtraction only once per the
outer page_walk loop iteration, but in the current version the
addition has to happen every pagemap_scan_output() call after a hole.

From the readability perspective, "if (next_index >=3D vec_len)" is
short and self-documenting. Also I'd use "p.vec_len =3D min(p.vec_len,
empty_slots - 1)" as it also conveys the intent better (in that `vec`
is holding all but the last entry, but arg.vec_len holds the final
output buffer length).

If we're picking colors, then maybe make `arg.vec_len` have a
different name than `p.vec_len` (same for `vec_index`) so that there
is less confusion possible as to what they refer to. Maybe keep
`arg.vec_len`, but have `p.vec_buf`, `p.vec_buf_len`, and
`p.next_buf_index`?

(Note: you'd also need to decrement p.vec_len where it is first assigned.)
