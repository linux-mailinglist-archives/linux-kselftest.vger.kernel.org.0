Subject: [PATCH] openat2: switch to __attribute__((packed)) for open_how
Date:   Sat, 14 Dec 2019 09:23:50 +1100
Message-Id: <20191213222351.14071-1-cyphar@cyphar.com>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

The design of the original open_how struct layout was such that it
ensured that there would be no un-labelled (and thus potentially
non-zero) padding to avoid issues with struct expansion, as well as
providing a uniform representation on all architectures (to avoid
complications with OPEN_HOW_SIZE versioning).

However, there were a few other desirable features which were not
fulfilled by the previous struct layout:

 * Adding new features (other than new flags) should always result in
   the struct getting larger. However, by including a padding field, it
   was possible for new fields to be added without expanding the
   structure. This would somewhat complicate version-number based
   checking of feature support.

 * A non-zero bit in __padding yielded -EINVAL when it should arguably
   have been -E2BIG (because the padding bits are effectively
   yet-to-be-used fields). However, the semantics are not entirely clear
   because userspace may expect -E2BIG to only signify that the
   structure is too big. It's much simpler to just provide the guarantee
   that new fields will always result in a struct size increase, and
   -E2BIG indicates you're using a field that's too recent for an older
   kernel.

 * While the alignment for u64s was manually backed by extra padding
   fields, some languages (such as Rust) do not currently support
   enforcing alignment of struct field members.

 * The padding wasted space needlessly, and would very likely not be
   used up entirely by future extensions for a long time (because it
   couldn't fit a u64).

While none of these outstanding issues are deal-breakers, we can iron
out these warts before openat2(2) lands in Linus's tree. Instead of
using alignment and padding, we simply pack the structure with
__attribute__((packed)). Rust supports #[repr(packed)] and it removes
all of the issues with having explicit padding.
