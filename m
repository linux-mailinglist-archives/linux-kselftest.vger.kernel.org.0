I wasn't talking about the documentation that is part of KUnit.  I was
targeting patch 0.

The high level issue is to provide reviewers with enough context to be
able to evaluate the patch series.  That is probably not very obvious
at this point in the thread.  At this point I was responding to Logan's
response to me that I should be reading Documentation to get a better
description of KUnit features.  I _think_ that Logan thought that I
did not understand KUnit features and was trying to be helpful by
pointing out where I could get more information.  If so, he was missing
my intended point had been that patch 0 should provide more information
to justify adding this feature.

One thing that has become very apparent in the discussion of this patch
series is that some people do not understand that kselftest includes
in-kernel tests, not just userspace tests.  As such, KUnit is an
additional implementation of "the same feature".  (One can debate
exactly which in-kernel test features kselftest and KUnit provide,
and how much overlap exists or does not exist.  So don't take "the
same feature" as my final opinion of how much overlap exists.)  So
that is a key element to be noted and explained.

I don't have a goal of finding all the things to include in patch 0,
that is really your job as the patch submitter.  But as a reviewer,
it is easy for me to point out an obvious hole, even if I don't find
all of the holes.  kselftest vs KUnit overlap was an obvious hole to
me.

So, yes, more of an explanation about the in-kernel testing available
via kselftest vs the in-kernel testing available via KUnit, and how
they provide the same or different functionality.  Should both exist?
Should one replace the other?  If one provides additional features,
should the additional features be merged into a common base?
