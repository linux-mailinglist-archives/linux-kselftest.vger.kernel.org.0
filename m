Hi David,

Yes, sure. Though it has to be through an ioctl since we need both input
and output semantics at the same call to keep the atomic semantics.

I answered Peter Enderborg about our concerns when turning this into an
ioctl.  But they are possible to overcome.

Yes, we did.  I think Usama can share some numbers.

The problem with userfaultfd, as far as I understand, is that it will
require a second userspace process to be called in order to handle the
annotation that a page was touched, before remapping the page to make it
accessible to the originating process, every time a page is touched.
This context switch is prohibitively expensive to our use case, where
Windows applications might invoke it quite often.  Soft-dirty bit
instead, allows the page tracking to be done entirely in kernelspace.

If I understand correctly, userfaultfd is usefull for VM/container
migration, where the cost of the context switch is not a real concern,
since there are much bigger costs from the migration itself.

Maybe we're missing some feature about userfaultfd that would allow us
to avoid the cost, but from our observations we didn't find a way to
overcome it.

That is something very specific about our use case, and we should
explain it a bit better.  The problem is that VM_SOFTDIRTY modifications
introduce the overhead of the mm write lock acquisition, which is very
visible in our benchmarks of Windows games running over Wine.

Since the main reason for VM_SOFTDIRTY to exist, as far as we understand
it, is to track vma remapping, and this is a use case we don't need to
worry about when implementing windows semantics, we'd like to be able to
avoid this extra overhead, optionally, iff userspace knows it can be
done safely.

VM_SOFTDIRTY is indeed an internal interface.  Which is why we are
proposing to expose the feature in terms of tracking VMA reuse.

Thanks,
