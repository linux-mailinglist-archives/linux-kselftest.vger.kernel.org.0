Quite a few folks have said that ->reserved is either unnecessary or
too big. I will be changing this, though I am not clear what the best
way of extending the structure is. If anyone has a strong opinion on
this (or an alternative to the ones listed below), please chime in. I
don't have any really strong attachment to this aspect of the API.

There appear to be a few ways we can do it (that all have precedence
with other syscalls):

 1. Use O_* flags to indicate extensions.
 2. A separate "version" field that is incremented when we change.
 3. Add a size_t argument to openat2(2).
 4. Reserve space (as in this patchset).

(My personal preference would be (3), followed closely by (2).)

The main problem with (1) is that it pollutes the open(2) and openat(2)
syscalls with new O_* flags, which is probably not a good API decision
(syscall flags are already "bad" enough, let's not throw a bunch of
no-ops into the mix).

(2) is mostly fine except for a slight issue of ergonomics (glibc would
have to auto-fill the version field or make wrappers in order to make it
easier to use sanely). But this does have the benefit that we could
re-arrange fields (not that this is something we'd want to do anyway).

Both (1) and (2) have the problem that the "struct version" is inside
the struct so we'd need to copy_from_user() twice. This isn't the end of
the world, it just feels a bit less clean than is ideal. (3) fixes that
problem, at the cost of making the API slightly more cumbersome to use
directly (though again glibc could wrap that away).

And the downsides of (4) are pretty well discussed already.
