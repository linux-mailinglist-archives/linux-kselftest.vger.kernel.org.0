I agree that FOLL_REMOTE probably needs separate treatment but also agree
that it's outside the context of this patch, particularly as a -stable
candidate so

Acked-by: Mel Gorman <mgorman@techsingularity.net>

I've a minor nit below that would be nice to get fixed up, but not
mandatory.

Expand on *why* KVM requires it even though I suspect this changes later
in the series. Maybe "Some GUP users like KVM require the hint to be as
the calling context of GUP is functionally similar to a memory reference
from task context"?

Also minor nit -- s/autonuma/NUMA Balancing/ or numab. autonuma refers to
a specific implementation of automatic balancing that operated similar to
khugepaged but not merged. If you grep for it, you'll find that autonuma
is only referenced in powerpc-specific code. It's not important these
days but very early on, it was very confusing if AutoNUMA was mentioned
when NUMAB was intended.
