That's your use case, but many other use cases are just "read a bunch of
sysfs files in one shot".  Examples of that are tools that monitor
uevents and lots of hardware-information gathering tools.

Also not all tools sem to be as smart as you think they are, look at
util-linux for loads of the "open/read/close" lots of files pattern.  I
had a half-baked patch to convert it to use readfile which I need to
polish off and post with the next series to show how this can be used to
both make userspace simpler as well as use less cpu time.

Is psutils using this type of interface, or do they constantly open
different files?

What about fun tools like bashtop:
	https://github.com/aristocratos/bashtop.git
which thankfully now relies on python's psutil package to parse proc in
semi-sane ways, but that package does loads of constant open/read/close
of proc files all the time from what I can tell.

And lots of people rely on python's psutil, right?

What "good" monitoring programs do you suggest follow the pattern you
recommend?
