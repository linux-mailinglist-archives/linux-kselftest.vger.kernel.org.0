No, this cannot be done because in do_pagemap_cmd() we don't know that we
have space for new pages in the output buffer or not because the next page
may be aggregated to already present data.

I'll try to check if I can optimize it. It seems like I should be able to
update this pretty easily by returning a negative status/error which
signifies that we have found the max_pages. Now just abort in sane way.

I don't know, we are adding more and more use cases as people are noticing
it. I've not thought about this use case. So I need more understanding
about it:
How should I identify "which pages are used"? Does use mean present and
swapped both? We we want to find present or swapped pages in other words
!pte_none pages and return in compact form, it can already be done by
ioctl(anyod_mask=PRESET | SWAPPED, return_mask=ALL).
