I do not expect a common uffd-wp async user to provide a fault handler at
all.  In my imagination it's in most cases used standalone from other uffd
modes; it means all the faults will still be handled by the kernel.  Here
we only leverage the accuracy of userfaultfd comparing to soft-dirty, so
not really real "user"-faults.

Will there be an ordering requirement for an async mode?  Considering it
should be async to whatever else, I would think it's not a problem, but
maybe I missed something.

Yes, I'm not against thinking of using similar structures here.  It's just
that it's definitely more complicated on the interface, at least we need
yet one more interface to setup the rings and define its interfaces.

Note that although Muhammud is defining another new interface here too for
pagemap, I don't think it's strictly needed for uffd-wp async mode.  One
can use uffd-wp async mode with PM_UFFD_WP which is with current pagemap
interface already.

So what Muhammud is proposing here are two things to me: (1) uffd-wp async,
plus (2) a new pagemap interface (which will closely work with (1) only if
we need atomicity on get-dirty and reprotect).

Defining new interface for uffd-wp async mode will be something extra, so
IMHO besides the heap allocation on the rings, we need to also justify
whether that is needed.  That's why I think it's fine to go with what
Muhammud proposed, because it's a minimum changeset at least for userfault
to support an async mode, and anything else can be done on top if necessary.

Going a bit back to the "lead to stall in extreme cases" above, just also
want to mention that the VM use case is slightly different - dirty tracking
is only heavily used during migration afaict, and it's a short period.  Not
a lot of people will complain performance degrades during that period
because that's just rare.  And, even without the ring the perf is really
bad during migration anyway... Especially when huge pages are used to back
the guest RAM.

Here it's slightly different to me: it's about tracking dirty pages during
any possible workload, and it can be monitored periodically and frequently.
So IMHO stricter than a VM use case where migration is the only period to
use it.

What I'm saying here is not half-log / half-scan, but use a single bitmap
to store what page is dirty, just like KVM_GET_DIRTY_LOG.  I think it
avoids any above "stall" issue.

Actually similar here. :) So I'm probably not the best one to describe what
is the best to look as API.

What I know is I think the new pagemap interface is welcomed by CRIU
developers, so it may be something good with/without userfaultfd getting
involved already.  I see this as "let's add one more bit for uffd-wp" in
the new interface only.

Quotting some link I got from Muhammud before with CRIU usage:

Yes, I agree.  I just don't know what's the best way to avoid this.

The issue here IIUC is Muhammud needs one operation to do what Windows does
with getWriteWatch() API.  It means we need to mix up GET and PROTECT in a
single shot.  If we want to use pagemap as GET, then no choice to PROTECT
also here to me.

I think it'll be the same to soft-dirty if it's used, it means we'll extend
soft-dirty modifications from clear_refs to pagemap too which I also don't
think it's as clean.

Not at all.  I just wished you joined earlier!
