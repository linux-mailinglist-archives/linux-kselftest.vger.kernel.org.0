We would have to, *iff* the goal is to provide *all* headers in nolibc.
May goal was more limited:
nolibc should be self-contained, it should be able to work at all
with -nostdinc.
If users need more standard headers for their application they can add
those either as shim, custom implementation or from the compiler.

I'm confused.

If the user doesn't want to use nolibc they should not explicitly add it
to the include path.

It makes sense to figure out what is needed by larger projects from a
libc. But it feels to me like a bug vs. feature discussion.

Making larger real-world applications work is a feature while making the
following work is a bugfix:

$ cat nolibc.c
#include "nolibc.h"

int main(void)
{
	return 0;
}

$ gcc -nostdinc -Isysroot/x86/include -c nolibc.c
In file included from sysroot/x86/include/nolibc.h:98,
                 from nolibc-test.c:1:
sysroot/x86/include/sys.h:10:10: fatal error: stdarg.h: No such file or directory
   10 | #include <stdarg.h>
      |          ^~~~~~~~~~

musl:

$ cat /usr/lib/musl/lib/musl-gcc.specs
...
*cc1:
%(cc1_cpu) -nostdinc -isystem /usr/lib/musl/include -isystem include%s
...


dietlibc:

$ cat Makefile
...
DEFAULTCFLAGS=-pipe -nostdinc -D_REENTRANT $(EXTRACFLAGS)
...


klibc re-adds the compilers include path,
This is an alternative we could also use:

$ cat Makefile
...
NOSTDINC_FLAGS := -nostdlib -nostdinc -isystem $(shell $(CC) -print-file-name=include)
...

(these are all I checked)

I think it's not really clearly defined what goes where.

There was also a longer discussion on LKML about linux/stdarg.h [0]

The gcc authors argue that Linux should not ship a custom stdarg.h.
But in reality Linux, musl, dietlibc (and probably some more) today are
shipping their own stdarg.h.

This is out of date. It's missing signal.h, stdint.h, unistd.h.

What does "expected" mean here?
nolibc itself is perfectly fine without float.h and stddef.h.

While true, a lot of other headers are also not provided.

I do understand.

To reiterate it here explicitly, in my opinion it's a worthwhile and
consistent goal to make "nolibc usable standalone with -nostdinc" for
maximal control by the user.

If not, I'd like to use the "-nostdinc -I$(cc -print-file-name=include)"
method to avoid dependencies on system header for nolibc-test
specifically.
