Thanks for the explanation.  I'm inferring that there is no solution to
this, but why can't we use mmu notifiers to invalidate the iommu on zap
or close?  I know that at least QEMU won't consider these sorts of
mapping fatal, so we could possibly change the default and make support
for such mappings opt-in, but I don't know if I'd break DPDK, or
potentially users within QEMU that make use of p2p between devices.
Thanks,

Alex
