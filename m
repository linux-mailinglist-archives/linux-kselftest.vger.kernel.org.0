‚Ä¶ but notwithstanding a clear definition of a moniker (which I agree indeed
you've made for most SPDX identifiers), if that definition fails to
adequately match historically understanding (and/or fails to take into
account nuances in the document it represents), confusion ensues for users.
Users *were* confused about ‚ÄúGPL-2.0‚Äù (remember, we did a small (admittedly
non-scientific) survey at a session at a conference ‚Äî FOSDEM I think it was?)

Most SPDX *users* won't speak its defined terms fluently; I suspect most of
Linux's licensors (and even most licensees) don't speak SPDX fluently, so
presumably you want SPDX identifiers to have some intuitiveness ‚Äî
particularly for the use case of linux-spdx, which requires the identifiers
to be *both* human-readable and machine-readable.

This is relevant to the copyleft-next-0.3.1 identifier.  SPDX could define
‚Äúcopyleft-next-0.3.1‚Äù to mean for SPDX purposes: ‚Äúthe text of copyleft-next
without any options in its terms exercised/removed‚Äù (‚Äî although I note
https://spdx.org/licenses/copyleft-next-0.3.1.html seems to be wholly silent
regarding options exercising/removing).  However, there is currently
confusion ‚Äî shown in the fact that Thomas still asked:
>>>> If I want to remove this option, then how do I express this with a SPDX
>>>> license identifier?  Sigh!
‚Ä¶ upon noticing this part of copyleft-next:
>>> +    Unless I explicitly remove the option of Distributing Covered Works
>>> +    under Later Versions, You may Distribute Covered Works under any Later
>>> +    Version.

Anyway, I'm pointing out SPDX's shortcomings on this point *not* to
captiously admonish SPDX, but rather to point out that any issues with SPDX
identifiers and their formal definitions shouldn't influence a decision about
what licenses are acceptable for inclusion as dual-license options in Linux.

Plus, I remain hopeful that over the long-term, the SPDX project will take
feedback from efforts like linux-spdx to solve the kinds of problems that
have come up in this thread and others.

Finally, I've already started a sub-thread on the copyleft-next list to start
discussing maybe the license (in future versions) shouldn't have this option
anyway (for unrelated policy reasons).  That might yield a side-benefit of
making the problem evaporate entirely for SPDX.  (Anyway, after 25 years of
living with GPL's ‚Äú-or-later vs. -only‚Äù mess ‚Äî I, for one, am convinced new
licenses like copyleft-next should try very hard to not repeat that mistake.)
