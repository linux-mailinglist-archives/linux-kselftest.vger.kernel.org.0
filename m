That is the question the coccinelle hunt is aimed at finding. Answering
that in the context of module removal is easier than the generic case.

But also note that I had mentioned before that we have semantics to
check *when* we're in the module removal case, and as such can address
that case. For the other cases we have no possible semantics to be able to
address a generic fix. I tried though, refer to my reply in this
thread and refer to the new kobject_being_removed() I'm adding:

https://lkml.kernel.org/r/YWdMpv8lAFYtc18c@bombadil.infradead.org

So we have semantics for knowing when about to remove a module but,
my attempt with kobject_being_removed() isn't sufficient to address this
generically.

In either case, having a gauge of how common this is either on module
removal of generally would be wonderful. It is easier to answer the
question from a module removal perspective though.

Alright thanks for confirming.
