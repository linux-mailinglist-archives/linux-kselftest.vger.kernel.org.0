Or maybe we want to get rid of VM_FAULT_OOM altogether... But this is
really tangent to this discussion. The only relation is that this would
be another place to check when somebody wants to go that direction.

From a quick look it is really similar in a sense that it effectively never
happens and if it does then it certainly does the wrong thing. The point
I was trying to make is that there is likely no need to go that way.
Fundamentally, not being able to handle direct map for the page fault
sounds like what SIGBUS should be used for. From my POV it is similar to
ENOSPC when FS cannot allocate metadata on the storage.
