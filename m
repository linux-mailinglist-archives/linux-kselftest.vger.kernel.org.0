Add support for shared futexes for cross-process resources. This design
relies on the same approach done in old futex to create an unique id for
file-backed shared memory, by using a counter at struct inode.

There are two types of futexes: private and shared ones. The private are
futexes meant to be used by threads that shares the same memory space,
are easier to be uniquely identified an thus can have some performance
optimization. The elements for identifying one are: the start address of
the page where the address is, the address offset within the page and
the current->mm pointer.

Now, for uniquely identifying shared futex:

- If the page containing the user address is an anonymous page, we can
  just use the same data used for private futexes (the start address of
  the page, the address offset within the page and the current->mm
  pointer) that will be enough for uniquely identifying such futex. We
  also set one bit at the key to differentiate if a private futex is
  used on the same address (mixing shared and private calls are not
  allowed).

- If the page is file-backed, current->mm maybe isn't the same one for
  every user of this futex, so we need to use other data: the
  page->index, an UUID for the struct inode and the offset within the
  page.

Note that members of futex_key doesn't have any particular meaning after
they are part of the struct - they are just bytes to identify a futex.
Given that, we don't need to use a particular name or type that matches
the original data, we only need to care about the bitsize of each
component and make both private and shared data fit in the same memory
space.
