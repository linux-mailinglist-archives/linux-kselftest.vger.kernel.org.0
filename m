Sorry for the delayed response.  I was on vacation over memorial day weeken=
d
(holiday in the US.)

I think that the option to reject a contribution based on its license shoul=
d be
available to the community, using criteria beyond those that Luis has menti=
oned
(and that you mention below).

I could create a license that was GPL-2.0-only compatible, and use it to co=
ver a new
contribution to the Linux kernel (in dual-license format), in order to get =
exposure
for the license or to promote it.  We could use the SPDX identifier "Tims-l=
icense-0.1".
I think it would be fair for the community to reject a contribution based
on those license circumstances, even though it met all the criteria you men=
tion.

I don't think that the Linux kernel should be used for license promotion, b=
ut if it is,
then it should be used to promote GPL-v2-only.

I was talking about why dual licensing was originally introduced, which was
a situation different from what went on in 2016, when the copyleft-next
dual license was discussed.

Dual-licensing in the Linux kernel was originally introduced because code w=
as being
taken from BSD and placed into Linux (under GPL v2), often by someone other=
 than the
original author.  This created a bit of hard feelings between the BSD commu=
nity
and the Linux community.  So dual-licensing was introduced so that derivati=
ve works
(created by Linux developers) of BSD code could flow back into the BSD proj=
ect.

This was code that existed before being introduced into Linux, and there wa=
s
no notion of using the kernel to promote the BSD license.

I have a problem with the statement:

"The reason why dual licensing is allowed is to share
 code across license preferences. The very same reason applies here."

I'm concerned about license proliferation, and that statement has no limiti=
ng principle.
Although you do raise some limiting principles below, I don't think they ar=
e adequate.
I don't think it should be the mission of the kernel to allow shared code a=
cross [any and all]
license preferences.

Just by way of example, I would hesitate to support the adoption into the k=
ernel of any
license that had an "or later" provision.  That's true, even on the other s=
ide of
an "OR" clause. Also, my preference would be to limit new licenses to OSI-a=
pproved
licenses, which have already had extensive vetting.

That's an over-generalization.

I missed the original discussion, and the license was limited in applicatio=
n.
I agree that my complaint is late, but this conversion to SPDX adds the lic=
ense
text to LICENSES, which IMHO makes this license stand out more than it
has previously, and possibly provides an implied endorsement.

I think it's a good thing to convert from the current language to an SPDX i=
dentifier.
And that I'm late to the party with complaints about this particular licens=
e.
But I'd rather not encourage developers to use this license going forward.

Burden on corporate lawyers (and, dare I say, OSPO people like myself
who deal in license training at our respective companies) has been a
consideration in past discussions of contributions.

The 2016  LKML thread about the original submission included
discussion about the amount of "lawyer ink" required for
different licensing constructs and development scenarios. For example, see
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20170518221205.gcfs2t4ihlpx5kj6@thunk.org/#t

I think we're talking about different sets of lawyers, so the rest of the c=
omplaint
about some lawyers and the costs they've imposed on the kernel community
I think is unrelated.

The fact that the conversion being discussed *now* may not yield
an identical licensing situation seems to warrant some legal discussion.
I assume Luis is on-board with the change in licensing situation due
to the conversion, but I have yet to see the final patches.

Yes.
I'm supportive of using SPDX in the kernel, as are all the lawyers I work w=
ith.

Try what again?  Communicating a preference on license proliferation?
That's what this message is.

I disagree.  There are other relevant points if the kernel is being used
to promote a license.  I have made all my contributions to the Linux kernel
(meager though they are) under GPL-v2-only.  I think straying from this
should be rare and well-justified.

I said that the textual terms of copyleft-next require the Internet archive
to interpret.  That's completely independent of what version control
system you use to track the license and its application to the kernel.
Linux kernel git logs are not going to tell you what the OSI and
FSF-approved licenses were in 2016.

*My* corporate lawyers and their "past sins"?  I think you're taking
actions by some lawyers and overgeneralizing them.  It is not unheard-of
to consider the cost in legal overhead in licensing considerations in the k=
ernel.

I believe Luis is working on an independent patch that isolates the SPDX
conversion from the changes to the testing module code.  As such, I'll give
feedback on new patches going forward.
