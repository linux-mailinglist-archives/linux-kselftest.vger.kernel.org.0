Hi,

Thank you for reviewing.

These operations can be performed by pagemap procfs file. Definitely
performing them through IOCTL will be faster. But I'm trying to add a
simple IOCTL by which some specific PTE bit can be read and cleared
atomically. This IOCTL can be extended to include other bits like file,
present and swap bits by keeping the interface simple. The following
mask advice is nice. But if we add that kind of masking, it'll start to
look like a filter on top of pagemap. My intention is to not duplicate
the functionality already provided by the pagemap. One may ask, then why
am I adding "get the soft-dirty pages" functionality? I'm adding it to
complement the get and clear operation. The "get" and "get and clear"
operations with special flag (PAGEMAP_SD_NO_REUSED_REGIONS) can give
results quicker by not splitting the VMAs.

Thank you for mentioning this. I'd considered this while development.
But I gave up and used the simple array to return the offsets of the
pages as in the problem I'm trying to solve, the dirty pages may be
present amid non-dirty pages. The range may not be useful in that case.
Also we want to return only a specific number of pages of interest. The
following paragraph explains it.
