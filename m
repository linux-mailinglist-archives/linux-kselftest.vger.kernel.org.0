There is a misunderstanding, I was responding to your proposition to
modify check_access_path_continue(), not about the behavior of landlock-v26.

It indeed works like this with landlock-v26. However, with your above
proposition, it would work like this:

$ LL_FS_RO='/tmp' LL_FS_RW='/' ./sandboxer dd if=/dev/null of=/tmp/aaa
0+0 records in
0+0 records out
0 bytes copied, 0.000187265 s, 0.0 kB/s

…which is not what users would expect I guess. :)
