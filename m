Add the explanation of the added ioctl on pagemap file. It can be used
to get, clear or both soft-dirty PTE bit of the specified range.

+Using IOCTL
+-----------
+
+The IOCTL on the ``/proc/PID/pagemap`` can be can be used to find the dirty pages
+atomically. The following commands are supported::
+
+	MEMWATCH_SD_GET
+		Get the page offsets which are soft dirty.
+
+	MEMWATCH_SD_CLEAR
+		Clear the pages which are soft dirty.
+
+	MEMWATCH_SD_GET_AND_CLEAR
+		Get and clear the pages which are soft dirty.
+
+The struct :c:type:`pagemap_sd_args` is used as the argument. In this struct:
+
+  1. The range is specified through start and len. The len argument need not be
+     the multiple of the page size, but since the information is returned for the
+     whole pages, len is effectively rounded up to the next multiple of the page
+     size.
+
+  2. The output buffer and size is specified in vec and vec_len. The offsets of
+     the dirty pages from start are returned in vec. The ioctl returns when the
+     whole range has been searched or vec is completely filled. The whole range
+     isn't cleared if vec fills up completely.
+
+  3. The flags can be specified in flags field. Currently only one flag,
+     PAGEMAP_SD_NO_REUSED_REGIONS is supported which can be specified to ignore
+     the VMA dirty flags for better performance. This flag shows only those pages
+     dirty which have been written to by the user. All new allocations aren't returned
+     to be dirty.

+Explanation

 Internally, to do this tracking, the writable bit is cleared from PTEs
 when the soft-dirty bit is cleared. So, after this, when the task tries to
