Fair, but how would you separate out the ftrace dump for the most
recent kernel boot?  (Though please see below.)

Boot loops can indeed be irritating.  So I created this commit:

10f84c2cfb50 ("torture: Avoid torture-test reboot loops")

This passes -no-reboot to qemu, which causes qemu to just stop when
it would otherwise reboot.  Much nicer!

The multiple-ftrace-dump issue could still appear should some torture
test decide to turn tracing back on at some point, perhaps in response
to a yet-as-unthought-of module parameter.

Should this ever be a problem, one approach would be to leave the
beginning/end markers and/or number them.

Ouch, will fix on next rebase.

It is the "simple" ones that bite you!  ;-)
