Updated commit log looks like below:

    In TDX guest, the attestation process is used to verify the TDX guest
    trustworthiness to other entities before provisioning secrets to the
    guest. The First step in the attestation process is TDREPORT
    generation, which involves getting the guest measurement data in the
    format of TDREPORT, which is further used to validate the authenticity
    of the TDX guest. TDREPORT by design is integrity-protected and can
    only be verified on the local machine.
    
    To support remote verification of the TDREPORT (in a SGX-based
    attestation), the TDREPORT needs to be sent to the SGX Quoting Enclave
    (QE) to convert it to a remote verifiable Quote. SGX QE by design can
    only run outside of the TDX guest (i.e. in a host process or in a
    normal VM) and the guest can use communication channels like vsock or
    TCP/IP to send the TDREPORT to the QE. But for security concerns, some
    platforms may not support these communication channels. To handle such
    cases, TDX defines a GetQuote hypercall which can be used by the guest
    to request the host VMM to communicate with the SGX QE. More details
    about GetQuote hypercall can be found in TDX Guest-Host Communication
    Interface (GHCI) for Intel TDX 1.0, section titled
    "TDG.VP.VMCALL<GetQuote>".
    
    Add support for TDX_CMD_GET_QUOTE IOCTL to allow an attestation agent
    to submit GetQuote requests from the user space using GetQuote
    hypercall.
    
    Since GetQuote is an asynchronous request hypercall, VMM will use the
    callback interrupt vector configured by the SetupEventNotifyInterrupt
    hypercall to notify the guest about Quote generation completion or
    failure. So register an IRQ handler for it.
    
    GetQuote TDVMCALL requires TD guest pass a 4K aligned shared buffer
    with TDREPORT data as input, which is further used by the VMM to copy
    the TD Quote result after successful Quote generation. Allocate the
    required shared memory once in tdx_guest_init() and reuse it in the
    TDX_CMD_GET_QUOTE IOCTL handler for GetQuote requests.
    
    Although this method reserves a fixed chunk of memory for GetQuote
    requests, such one-time allocation is preferable to the alternative
    choice of repeatedly allocating/freeing the shared buffer in the
    TDX_CMD_GET_QUOTE IOCTL handler, which will damage the direct map
    (because the sharing/unsharing process modifies the direct map). This
    allocation model is similar to that used by the AMD SEV guest driver.
    
    Since the Quote generation process is not time-critical or frequently
    used, the current version do not support parallel GetQuote requests.

I have added it to support buf length changes in future (like adding a
command line option to allow user change the GET_QUOTE_MAX_SIZE).  Also,
IMO, using buf_len is more readable than just using GET_QUOTE_MAX_SIZE
macro in all places.

As a precaution against spurious event notification. I also believe that in
the future, event notification IRQs may be used for other purposes such as
vTPM or other TDVMCALL services, and that this handler may be triggered
without a valid GetQuote request. So, before we process the IRQ, I want to
make sure we have a valid buffer.

I don't want to use multiple global values. So I have bundled all Quote related
book keeping (completion object or buffer pointer) in the same struct.

Since the buf cannot be NULL as per current implementation,

Ok makes sense. I will use alloc_pages_exact()/free_pages_exact().

How about the following comment?

I can name it as struct tdx_quote_data
