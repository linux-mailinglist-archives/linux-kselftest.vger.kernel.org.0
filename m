So there's two patchworks (snowpatch makes the 3rd): the one on
freedesktop is another fork.

> Has any discussion taken place trying to consolidate some of the forks?

Yup, but didn't lead anywhere unfortunately :-/ At least between patchwork
and patchwork-fdo, I think snowpatch happened in parallel and once it was
done it's kinda too late. The trouble is that they all have slightly
different REST api and functionality, so for CI integration you can't just
switch one for the other.

We have a pretty big farm of machines that mostly just crunch through
premerge patch series. postmerge is mostly just for statistics (so we can
find the sporadic failures and better characterize them).

Yeah see above, it's a bit a complicated story. I think there's a total of
3 patchworks now :-/
