Sorry for the late reply as I was busy with other works.

I agree with you on principle. However, the reason why there are more 
restrictions on enabling partition is because I want to avoid forcing 
the users to always read back cpuset.partition.type to see if the 
operation succeeds instead of just getting an error from the operation. 
The former approach is more error prone. If you don't want changes in 
existing behavior, I can relax the checking and allow them to become an 
invalid partition if an illegal operation happens.

Also there is now another cpuset patch to extend cpu isolation to cgroup 
v1 [1]. I think it is better suit to the cgroup v2 partition scheme, but 
cgroup v1 is still quite heavily out there.

Please let me know what you want me to do and I will send out a v3 version.

Thanks a lot!
Longman
