Adding a couple more tests will only help in the long run. The idea is
to see can this help

Maybe that is a good start. To get the tests that are already in use
and get them in shape for upstream.

That is probably the initial thought. However, it makes perfect sense
to add a couple of tests in. We have a few weeks anyway and it gives
us more confidence on kunit.

I already have a branch that is in linux-next and it just has kunit in
it and I will rebase it to 5.4-rc1.

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/shuah/linux-kselftest.git/log/?h=test

Let's use that for kunit work for 5.5. I won't add any kselftest patches
to it and keep it dedicated for kunit work. When tests are ready for
upstream, I can keep adding them to this branch.

thanks,
