My Dearest,

Please forgive me for stressing you with my predicaments as I know
that this letter may come to you as a big surprise.

Actually, I came across your E-mail from my personal search afterward
I decided to email you directly believing that you will be honest to
fulfil my final wish before anything happens to me. Meanwhile, I am
Madam Alice Walton, 71 years old childless widow from France but i
reside and doing Gold mining business in Africa before i fall sick.

I am suffering from Adenocarcinoma Cancer of the lungs for the past 8
years and from all indication my condition is really deteriorating as
my doctors have confirmed and courageously advised me that I may not
live beyond 3 weeks from now for the reason that my tumor has reached
a critical stage which has defiled all forms of medical treatment.

Since my days are numbered, I=E2=80=99ve decided willingly to fulfil my
long-time vow to donate to the less privileges the sum of($18.5
million dollars) I deposited in my offshore account over 7 years now
because I have tried to handle this project by myself but I have seen
that my health could not allow me to do so anymore.

My promise to God includes building of well-equipped charity
foundation/hospital and a technical school for the orphans and less
privileges.

Since i am not capable to handle this again myself due to my critical
health condition,please i need your consent to help me receive my
money from the bank and use it to do this divine works of God in your
country in my name so that my soul can be at rest if anything happens
to me.

If you will be honest, kind and willing to assist me handle this
charity project as I=E2=80=99ve mentioned here, I will like you to provide =
me
your personal data like,

(1) Your full name:
(2) country:
(3) Occupation:
(4) phone number:
(5) Age:

Let me have this data so that i can link you up with my bank as my
representative and receiver of the funds now that i am still alive.

Warmest Regards!
Mrs. Alice Walton
