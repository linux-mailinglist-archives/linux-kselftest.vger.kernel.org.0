Yes, I did! Thank you, I appreciate it!

Of course, I feel as though I ought to address any and all valid comments.

I didn't mean to sound dismissive. I was only referring to what was
present in the actual header itself. There really isn't much there; it
provides a function which takes an expression, evaluates it,
increments a counter of all tests, and if false, prints out a warning;
also, it provides a module init which runs the user defined test
function called selftest(), and then prints the number of tests that
passed and the number of tests that failed; that's it. I was just
trying to make the point that it is pretty bare bones, and isn't
really much of a framework.

Oh, sorry, I forgot that more were listed in the thread.

You are right about me missing a number of the tests, but there really
is not much infrastructure in kselftest for this at all. It really
doesn't impose any structure of any kind other than that there must be
exactly one static function named selftest() that takes no arguments;
and then you use KSTM_CHECK_ZERO() to do some checks; that's it. It
doesn't have anything else in the actual kselftest module stuff.

I think I understand what you are saying, but the point I was trying
to make here is that it is so simplistic, it doesn't really
conceptually overlap since it is so limited in what structure and
features it provides. It's kind of like what Ted said previously about
how you have C so you can technically do whatever you want, but there
is nothing inherent to the kselftest test module that does any of
those things (other than what I mentioned above).

Sure, I don't want to debate the point further either (I had a hard
time understanding what the point was at the end myself).

Nevertheless, I do want to make sure that I addressed this because I
think you did indeed have a point that was worth addressing, and I
don't want to waste anyone's time in the future by not addressing it.

Nevertheless, like I said, I don't want to get too detailed on the
topic otherwise like Shuah suggests later, it might end up just
leading people to draw a comparison that doesn't need to be made, but
I also don't want to misrepresent anything. In anycase, I will follow
up on this point directly with Shuah.

> Thanks for adding this section to address the issue.

No need to thank me; that is what I felt is the correct thing to do. I
didn't address the point before and it caused you and other to spend a
lot of time debating the point.

Also, it looks like Shuah is asking me to drop the section. I will
discuss this point further there.

Thanks!
