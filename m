We have a few tests do ifdef to be able to test the code as well as deal
with config specific tests. Not an issue.

Parsing /proc/cmdline line is flexible for sure, if you want to use that
route.

Thank you for finding the problem and identifying missing coverage. Look
forward to any patches fixing the problem.
