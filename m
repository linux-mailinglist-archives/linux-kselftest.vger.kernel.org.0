I think it depends on the details of how entries are added and removed
from the pool. I am behind on the pp details at this point, so I do need
to do some homework.

It has to do with the usability of this overall solution. As I mentioned
most ML use cases can (and will want to) use many memory allocations for
receiving packets - e.g., allocations per message and receiving multiple
messages per socket connection.

I am not referring to 1:N or N:1 for page pool and queues. I am
referring to entries within a single page pool for a single Rx queue.
