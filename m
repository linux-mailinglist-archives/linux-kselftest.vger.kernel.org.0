Right, sorry I thought I had made this point earlier, perhaps in a sub-thread of
a thread of thread. It felt as if you guys were acting as if that were
immaterial, which is why I highlighted it again.

Text is a poor medium, sorry!

I don't mean to say you're doing that purposefully on any level, I mean to
say that, by arguing here over something that feels kind of unimportant, we
are inadvertently doing that.

Sure, and I'm passionate about tests (I've written _thousands_ of lines of
tests recently!) I mention this as a related example of something that
feels out of scope.

Equally as the pidfd.h test header already had other instances of exactly
what I did and thus really should have been solved as a separate series
(one that I'd have been happy to do myself), I feel this issue, if truly a
problem should be considered separately.

Yes, I get that, rather a Brit element to this, to be clear - I am not
distraught, merely mildly perturbed. Again text is a bloody awful medium!

This genuinely was meant to be tongue in cheek, BUT I realise it's a me
issue on this kind of thing - obviously written down like that it comes off
as possibly dripping with a kind of venom that was ABSOLUTELY not intended.

Whereas my intent was a sort of wry smile, 'come on guys this doesn't
matter' thing.

But since this is the second time now that I've said something intended
that way and having been received as quite something different - this is a
me thing - and I will refrain from dalliances into the rhetorical like this
in future!

Apologies if either you or Pedro took offence and I'm fine! Other than this
damn cold that wont' go away...

And I consider you one of the loveliest people in the kernel and very very
sharp, and have enjoyed meeting you and your erstwhile colleague Jason :)

To be clear - I also have high regard for Pedro who I consider very smart,
and I don't say that lightly.

I mean this _whole series_ is his idea, for instance. I don't just write
series based on an idea on review for just anyone ;)

So this is not at all intended to be a critique of either of you, as I have
the utmost regard for you both...!

Well some of higher 'strength' have more basis than others that may be my
failing to communicate things quite as intended. We'd have to speak on a
case-by-case basis :)

But in Vlastimil's case, that was absolutely not intended. Again text is a
bad medium!

No it's fine, I think just a comms thing here.

Please do carry on reviewing it is all much appreciated... I promise!

Anyway on this issue, as I said, and meant - I will respin with this taken
out to alleviate concerns.

The _far_ more pressing issue I think is the one Pedro raised about the
actual PIDFD_SELF* values. I may simply choose some arbitrary ones in the
range specified by Pedro on respin.


Thanks! And I guess I owe you both beers ;)
