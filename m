You have a point, and clone3's way of dealing with it does make life
easier. It also removes the need to care about explicit padding and
padding holes entirely.

Of course we'll give -EINVAL with invalid values, that's one of the
reasons openat2(2) exists after all. :P

Right, I was suggesting to move the u16 field later in the struct too.
But after thinking about it some more, it doesn't help with
extensibility at all (a subsequent non-u16 extension will leave holes).
So I'm probably just going to go with either the -E2BIG patch or switch
to u64s.

You don't need to /explicitly/ memset(), since

	struct open_how how =3D { .flags =3D O_RDWR, .resolve =3D RESOLVE_IN_ROOT =
};

or even

	struct open_how how =3D {}; /* or { 0 } if you prefer. */

will clear all of the unused fields.

But, I can add a NOTE to the man-page to clarify that this is how users
should fill their structs (or rather, that they should zero-fill them
somehow to avoid this problem).

While this might be a little annoying, I would argue that given the
openat2(2) man page explains how extensions work (in great detail) and
mentions several times that the structure may have new fields added to
it in the future -- programs which don't zero-fill the struct should be
simply seen as buggy. Note that those buggy programs *will still work*
on new kernels -- until you recompile them with new headers (because
they made an incorrect assumption about the structures they were using).

As an aside, the other downside from the uapi side is that we would
probably have to spend flag bits *that are shared with openat(2)* for
such extensions, so I'd like to avoid that as much as necessary.

Only if they're explicitly doing something like

	struct open_how how;
	how.flags =3D O_RDWR;
	how.resolve =3D RESOLVE_IN_ROOT;
	memset(how.__padding, 0, sizeof(how.__padding));

As above, given the description of extensions in the man-page, I would
consider that style of struct initialisation to be eyebrow-raising at
best.

I'm sorry, but I'm simply against the idea of silently ignoring garbage
that userspace passes to the kernel -- even if it's tied to a flag. That
has proven to be an awful idea and in fact openat2(2) was written
precisely to fix this problem. To be honest, this reminds me of
(hypothetical) code like:

   int flags;
   flags |=3D O_PATH | O_CLOEXEC;
   open("foo", flags); /* yay, mystery fds! */

IMHO that shouldn't have ever worked, and the only way to stop userspace
=66rom passing garbage is to always reject it.
