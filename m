Its quite apparant for whoever is compiling userspace for non-RVA23 hardware.
First sspush/sspopchk instruction in ld/libc will do illegal instruction. It
won't even come to vDSO's sspush/sspopchk.

But sure if that's what get these patches merged in, I can add that comment.

Yes that can be done but that shouldn't gate current patchset from merging in.

Argument to block current patches is below
"Kernel should be binary portable". That's why I gave that argument.
A kernel compiled with shadow stack (kcfi) is not portable on non-RVA23
hardware.

Yes we can try making kernel portable by carrying two different vDSO.
One that is for non-RVA23 (actually non-zimop) hardware and one for
RVA23 hardware. But I don't imagine a distro shipping two different
userspaces (ld/glibc, everything) once they start compiling their
userspace with RVA23. If for an instance they start compiling two
userspaces, its not that big of an effort to compile kernel differently
as well. If for an instance they choose to only support rv64gc for
userspace then they are not opting anyways for CFI then just not select
that option in kernel compile. I just don't see a scenario where kernel
is forced to carry two different libraries while rest of the userspace
will not distribute two different binaries for same release.

>here, as kernel-level APIs are more flexible by nature.

I didn't get it. How kernel level APIs help with binary portability
of a kernel compiled in with shadow stack instructions to run on hardware
where these instructions are illegal?
