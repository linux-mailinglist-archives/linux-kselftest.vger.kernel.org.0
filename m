It may fail at $PF time as well:

hugetlb_fault()
        hugeltb_no_page()
                ...
                alloc_huge_page()
                        alloc_gigantic_page()
                                cma_alloc()
                                        -ENOMEM;

Any #PF can get -ENOMEM for whatever reason. Sucks huge indeed.

I would also very much like to see, for example, reasoning to enabling 1GB
pages in the direct map beyond "because we can" (commits 00d1c5e05736
("x86: add gbpages switches") and ef9257668e31 ("x86: do kernel direct
mapping at boot using GB pages")).

The original Kconfig text for CONFIG_DIRECT_GBPAGES said

          Enable gigabyte pages support (if the CPU supports it). This can
          improve the kernel's performance a tiny bit by reducing TLB
          pressure.

So it is very interesting how tiny that bit was.

And what being a scarce resource here? If we consider lack of the direct
map fragmentation as this resource, there enough measures secretmem
implements to limit user ability to fragment the direct map, as was already
discussed several times. Global limit, memcg and rlimit provide enough
access control already.
