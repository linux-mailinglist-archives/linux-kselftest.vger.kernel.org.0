So no existing functionality has been broken.

The entire file may not fit into available memory to measure and 
verify.  Hence the reason for a partial read.

Is there some way we could add a flag when calling the 
request_firmware_into_buf to indicate it is ok that the data requested 
does not need to be measured?
