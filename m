Suffering from the rest is what I am trying to avoid.

Running in the kernel is the point behind KUnit. It could be done by putting
all the userspace test into a initramfs and run them on boot from there.
But that has other drawbacks:
* The tests can't be run on an existing system.
* All tests need to be loaded into memory together, and not on demand.
* The tests can not be rerun.

This was a response to one specific statement. Could you be a bit more specific
in your critique? I am not sure what exactly you mean in some cases, making it
hard to respond properly. For example "bloat", it is bloaty
* source code,
* object code for users enabling the new kconfig options,
* object code for other users *not* enabling the new kconfig options?

That specific wording wasn't used. Obviously...
So far nobody had any issues with the overall goal of the series.
There was criticism around implementation details and I have been and will be
working on resolving those.

Some feedback I got:

David [0]: "I've taken quite a liking to it: it'd definitely have made my
life easier more than once."
Benjamin is already playing with it, having built his own testcase [1].
I asked Shuah about it before starting development and she gave a go-ahead.
A collegue of mine is also using it to validate the PREEMPT_RT safety of
various UAPIs by combining KUnit UAPI with a runtime validator [2].

To make it easier to test a wide range of architectures by not requiring a
libc from the toolchain. It also avoids relying on a bunch of out-of-tree
code (glibc) as part of the test. And there are existing kselftests which
use it over glibc for their own reasons.

But using nolibc in test code is not necessary and nobody is forced to do so.

(Maybe a disclaimer that I'm one of the nolibc maintainers is in order)

(...)

To run kselftests we need the following things:
a) A toolchain which can build userspace executables.
b) Quite a bit of supporting userland, at least glibc, coreutils and bash.
c) A rootfs assembled out of these.
d) An efficient way to incrementally rebuild the test executables and rootfs.
e) A way to put that rootfs into the system under test.
f) A way to configure a kernel which
   * is as small as possible and as fast as possible to build,
   * can run on QEMU or a real machine,
   * can run the functionality under test.
g) A way to select the tests to run in the system under test.
h) A way to communicate back the results.
i) Something to interpret the results.
j) Hook up everything into a CI system.

And for all of this there should be good in-tree tooling.

For a) and b) I am not aware of any toolchain provider or distribution which
provides this for all necessary architectures. And the existing userspace test
frameworks don't even try to address the points a) to e)/f) and let the user
figure it out. This is the case for xfstests and LTP. virtme(-ng) provide most
of it but don't support cross-architecture setups. On the other hand the tree
already contains solutions for most of those points. a) and d) are solved by
kbuild userprogs, e) to j) by KUnit and my new framework plugs b) and c).
Moving to a pure userspace solution would preclude the usage of KUnit as far as
I can see.

This all started when I worked on the generic vDSO data storage patches [3].
I needed to run the existing vDSO selftests against a bunch of architectures,
including some esoteric ones [4]. With my framework, running the vDSO selftests
for any architecture is now trivial and blazingly fast.

Does this make more sense?

I fail to understand how this test code is worse than the existing KUnit test
code. This is not meant to test complex scenarios, but single system calls or
specific UAPIs, which may depend on architecture features. For example timers,
signals, vDSO, mm etc.

Is "well known and tested userland code" referring to glibc or testing
frameworks? As mentioned above, glibc can be used just fine and the frameworks
I know about are lacking.
