Right, but at least currently, it behaves like any other CMA allocation 
(IIRC they are all unmovable and, therefore, not swappable). In the 
future, if pages would be movable (but not swappable), I guess it might 
makes more sense. I assume we never ever want to swap secretmem.

"man getrlimit" states for RLIMIT_MEMLOCK:

"This is the maximum number of bytes of memory that may be
  locked into RAM.  [...] This limit affects
  mlock(2), mlockall(2), and the mmap(2) MAP_LOCKED operation.
  Since Linux 2.6.9, it also affects the shmctl(2) SHM_LOCK op‐
  eration [...]"

So that place has to be updated as well I guess? Otherwise this might 
come as a surprise for users.

Yes

I'd say it is right now comparable to secretmem - which is why I though 
similar accounting would make sense.
