I don't think it would be possible to safely replace inode_operations
after the inode's been made visible in caches.

It works with file_operations because when a file is opened a new struct
file is allocated which isn't reachable anywhere before fd_install() is
called. So it is possible to replace f_ops in the default
f->f_op->open() method (which is what devices do as the inode is located
on e.g., ext4/xfs/tmpfs but the functionality of the device usually
provided by some driver/module through its file_operations). The default
f_ops are taken from i_fop of the inode.

The lifetime of the file_/inode_operations will be aligned with the
lifetime of the module they're originating from. If only
file_/inode_operations are used from within the same module then there
should never be any lifetime concerns.

So an inode doesn't explictly pin file_/inode_operations because there's
usually no need to do that and it be weird if each new inode would take
a reference on the f_ops/i_ops on the off-chance that someone _might_
open the file. Let alone the overhead of calling try_module_get()
everytime a new inode is added to the cache. There are various fs
objects - the superblock which is pinning the filesystem/module - that
exceed the lifetime of inodes and dentries. Both also may be dropped
from their respective caches and readded later.

Pinning of the module for f_ops is done because it is possible that some
filesystem/driver might want to use the file_operations of some other
filesystem/driver by default and they are in separate modules. So the
fops_get() in do_dentry_open is there because it's not guaranteed that
file_/inode_operations originate from the same module as the inode
that's opened. If the module is still alive during the open then a
reference to its f_ops is taken if not then the open will fail with
ENODEV.

That's to the best of my knowledge.

Sure thing.
