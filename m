Thanks.  No plan to run it, just to make sure I understand why such a

If it's multi-threaded test especially when the ioctl runs together with
the writers, then I'd assume it's caused by writers frequently need to
flush tlb (when writes during UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT), the flush target could
potentially also include the core running the main thread who is also
trying to reprotect because they run on the same mm.

This makes me think that your current test case probably is the worst case
of Nadav's patch 6ce64428d6 because (1) the UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT covers a
super large range, and (2) there're a _lot_ of concurrent writers during
the ioctl, so all of them will need to trigger a tlb flush, and that tlb
flush will further slow down the ioctl sender.

While I think that's the optimal case sometimes, of having minimum tlb
flush on the ioctl(UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT), so maybe it makes sense somewhere
else where concurrent writers are not that much. I'll need to rethink a bit
on all these to find out whether we can have a good way for both..

For now, if your workload is mostly exactly like your test case, maybe you
can have your pagemap version of WP-only op there, making sure tlb flush is
within the pgtable lock critical section (so you should be safe even
without Nadav's patch).  If so, I'd appreciate you can add some comment
somewhere about such difference of using pagemap WP-only and
ioctl(UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT), though.  In short, functional-wise they should
be the same, but trivial detail difference on performance as TBD (maybe one
day we can have a good approach for all and make them aligned again, but
maybe that also doesn't need to block your work).
