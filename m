yes, reserve at mmap time and use during the fault. But this all sounds
like a self inflicted problem to me. Sure you can have a pre-allocated
or more dynamic pool to reduce the direct mapping fragmentation but you
can always fall back to regular allocatios. In other ways have the pool
as an optimization rather than a hard requirement. With a careful access
control this sounds like a manageable solution to me.
