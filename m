OK, then I think the contract just has to be that userspace, in a
process that might dynamically disable shadow stack, needs to do
something like xor %reg,%reg before rdssp so that the outcome is
deterministic in disabled case.

Up til this thread, my position was pretty much "nope" because it
looked like it could not be done in a way compatible with existing
interface requirements.

However, what's been discussed here, contingent on a dynamic-disable
(ideally allowing choice of per-thread or global, to minimize loss of
hardening properties),

Personally, I believe shadow stack has very low hardening value
relative to cost/complexity, and my leaning would be just to ignore
it. However, I also know it becomes marketing pressure, including
pressure on distros that use musl -- "Why doesn't [distro] do shadow
stack?? I thought you were security oriented!!!" -- and if it can be
done in a non-breaking and non-invasive way, I think it's reasonable
to pursue and make something work.

Yes, this is potentially an argument for something like the option 2,
if there's a way to leave SS enabled but then trap when something goes
wrong, detect if it went wrong via SS-incompatible library code, and
lazily disable SS, otherwise terminate.

But I just realized, I'm not even sure why shared libraries need to be
explicitly SS-compatible. Unless they're doing their own asm stack
switches, shouldn't they just work by default? And since I don't
understand this reason, I also don't understand what the failure mode
is when an incompatible library is loaded, and thus whether it would
be possible to detect and attribute the failure to the library, or
whether the library would induce failure somewhere else.

Anyway, a mechanism to allow the userspace implementation to disable
SS doesn't inherently expose a means to do that. A system integrator
doing maximum hardening might choose to build all libraries as
SS-compatible, or to patch the loader to refuse to load incompatible
libraries.
