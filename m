That's fair. If that is indeed your only concern, then I don't think
the wrapper script will ever be an issue for you. You will always be
able to execute a given test the old fashioned/manual way, and the
wrapper script only summarizes results, it does not change the
contents.

That seems to be a valid concern. I would reiterate that you shouldn't
be concerned by any processing done by the wrapper script itself, but
the reality is that depending on what happens with automated
testing/presubmit/CI other people might end up parsing and
transforming test results - it might happen, it might not. I currently
have a CI system set up for KUnit on my public repo that I don't think
you would be offended by, but I don't know what we are going to do
when it comes time to integrate with existing upstream CI systems.

In anycase, I don't think that either sticking with or doing away with
the wrapper script is going to have any long term bearing on what
happens in this regard.

Cheers
