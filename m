OK, I'll replace each command with a specific syscall. I don't think
there will be much more commands/syscalls than these four and it will
make a better API.

The goal is to easily "type" the attr pointers (arguments 3 to 6), not
the command, to avoid future attr composability issues (for the same
command). However, with one syscall per command, these kind of options
may not be required.

The other reason to set an option bit for each command is to avoid empty
fields in struct landlock_attr_features, which enables to detect if a
specific command is supported. However, if necessary, a "commands" field
can be use for such usage.

We need the attr_ptr/attr_size pattern because the number of ruleset
properties will increase (e.g. network access mask).

This may be a good idea in general, but in the case of Landlock, because
this kind of (discretionary) sandboxing should be a best-effort security
feature, we should avoid incompatible behavior. In practice, every
unknown bit returns an error because userland can probe for available
bits thanks to the get_features command. This kind of (in)compatibility
can then be handled by userland.

I suggest this syscall signature:
SYSCALL_DEFINE3(landlock_create_ruleset, __u32, options, const struct
landlock_attr_ruleset __user *, ruleset_ptr, size_t, ruleset_size);

To avoid adding a new syscall for each new rule type (e.g. path_beneath,
path_range, net_ipv4_range, etc.), I think it would be better to keep
the attr_ptr/attr_size pattern and to explicitely set a dedicated option
flag to specify the attr type.

This would look like this:
SYSCALL_DEFINE4(landlock_add_rule, __u32, options, int, ruleset, const
void __user *, rule_ptr, size_t, rule_size);

The rule_ptr could then point to multiple types like struct
landlock_attr_path_beneath (without the current ruleset_fd field).

Right, but for consistency I prefer to change the arguments like this:
SYSCALL_DEFINE2(landlock_enforce, __u32 options, int, ruleset);


About the get_features command, because the number of features will
increase, the corresponding syscall should look like this:
SYSCALL_DEFINE3(landlock_get_features, __u32, options, struct
landlock_attr_features __user *, features_ptr, size_t features_size);
