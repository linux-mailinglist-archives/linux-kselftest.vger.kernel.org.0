Thank you for identifying it. Your understanding seems on point. I'll have
research things up about PTE Markers. I'm looking at your patches about it
[1]. Can you refer me to "mm alignment sessions" discussion in form of
presentation or if any transcript is available?

Is this discussion public? For what application you were looking into this?
I'll dig down to see how can I contribute to it.

I truly understand how you feel about export_prev_to_out(). It is really
difficult to understand. Even I had to made a hard try to come up with the
current code to avoid consuming a lot of kernel's memory while giving user
the compact output. I can surely map both of these with a dirty looking
macro. But I'm unable to find a decent macro to replace these. I think I'll
put a comment some where to explain whats going-on.
