This patch has merged into the mainline by the commit 303f8e2d0200
("selftests/kselftest/runner/run_one(): allow running non-executable files").
However, this patch has not added to v5.15.y, while there are some selftests
having no execution permission, including that for DAMON.  As a result, the
selftests always fail unless this patch is manually applied.  Could you please
add this patch to v5.15.y?  I confirmed this patch can cleanly cherry-picked on
the latest v5.15.y.


Thanks,
SJ
