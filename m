I *am* supporting all architectures with this patchset.

The first patch in this series adds support to all architectures
except UML (admittedly I only tried x86 and ARM, 32 bit and 64 bit for
both, but I am pretty sure someone tried it for POWER and something
else, so maybe I should try it with others before submission). A patch
specific for UML, this patch, was needed because UML is a special
snowflake and has a bunch of special linker scripts that don't make
the change in vmlinux.lds.h (the previous patch) sufficient.

I am *very* aware.

I would never intentionally break support for other architectures. I
know it is very important to you, Alan, and others.

Hopefully I can reassure you then:

With Alan as a regular contributor who cares very much about non-UML
architectures, it would be very unlikely for me to accidentally break
support for other architectures without us finding out before a
release.

I also periodically test KUnit on linux-next on x86-64. I have gotten
bugs for other architectures from Arnd Bergmann and one of the m86k
maintainers who seems to play around with it as well.

So yeah, other people care about this too, and I would really not want
to make any of them unhappy.

Sure, I think that's a great start! Thanks for that. I hope you don't
mind if I copy and paste some of it.

It kind of sounds like you are talking about more of a requirements
doc than the design doc I was imagining in my reply to you on the
cover letter, which is fine. The documentation is primarily for people
other than me, so whatever you and others think is useful, I will do.
