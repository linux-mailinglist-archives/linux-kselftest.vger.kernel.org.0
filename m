You're adding a new feature the semantics of which is already
different from what is in there, you can extend it any way as long
as it makes sense and agreed on. IMHO, it does. But well, if
there is a better solution I'm all for it.

I don't get it, what bug? page_pool_clear_pp_info() is not called
for ppiov because it doesn't make sense to call it for ppiov,
there is no reason to clear ppiov->pp, nor there is any pp_magic.

Lovely, I'll take a look later! (also assuming it's in v5)
