I'm extremely sorry for the annoyance. I absolutely understand your point.
The problem is that the half of this IOCTL wouldn't be useful without
solving the extra soft-dirty pages issue. We don't want to upstream
something which we wouldn't be using until 2 is solved. This is why we are
trying to solve the point 2 before upstreaming the 1. I'm working on ideas
on how this can be resolved or redesigned entirely. Maybe Cyril will share
the ideas soon once he has some time. He was involved in the soft-dirty
feature development.
