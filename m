That doesn't make sense does it? The tests might not be limited to
fs/ext4. We might have other sub-systems that add tests.

So, we will have to work to make linux-next as the base for new
development and limit the number of tests to where it will be
easier work in this mode for 5.5. We can stage the pull requests
so that kunit lands first followed by tests.

We have a similar situation with kselftest as well. Sub-systems
send tests that depend on their tress separately.
