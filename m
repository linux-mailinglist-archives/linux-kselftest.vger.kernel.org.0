A few folks on the SPDX legal team did a summary chart of all the 
nuances and while I'm not going to go down that road again, suffice to 
say, the "or later" clauses have more variation than most people would 
think (which is probably b/c most people don't need to pay attention to 
it). The "+" operator is always available if someone so chooses to apply 
it as needed.

Agreed.

I would agree with this characterization, except this was the outcome 
the FSF wanted, so ostensibly they were happy (and you forgot that 
GPL-2.0+ ).
(And to give credit where credit is due, Bradley's input during that 
challenging "negotiation" was very helpful. :)

To be clear, the GPL-2.0 identifier was never an error by the SPDX team 
- we were always very clear as to what it meant/means. It was that the 
FSF didn't like it. That is clearly explained in the blog post on the 
SPDX website, as well as the post on the FSF site on the subject.
