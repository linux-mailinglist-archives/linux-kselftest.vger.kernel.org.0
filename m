At the time, we are supporting 4 flags (PAGE_IS_WRITTEN, PAGE_IS_FILE,
PAGE_IS_PRESENT and PAGE_IS_SWAPPED). The idea is that user mention his
flags of interest in the return_mask. If he wants only 1 flag, he'll
specify it. Definitely if user wants only 1 flag, initially it doesn't make
any sense to mention in the return mask. But we want uniformity. If user
want, 2 or more flags in returned, return_mask becomes compulsory. So to
keep things simple and generic for any number of flags of interest
returned, the return_mask must be specified even if the flag of interest is
only 1.

I've found excluded_mask very intuitive as compared to negated_mask which
is so difficult to understand that I don't know how to use it correctly.
Lets take an example, I want pages which are PAGE_IS_WRITTEN and are not
PAGE_IS_FILE. In addition, the pages must be PAGE_IS_PRESENT or
PAGE_IS_SWAPPED. This can be specified as:

required_mask = PAGE_IS_WRITTEN
excluded_mask = PAGE_IS_FILE
anyof_mask = PAGE_IS_PRESETNT | PAGE_IS_SWAP

(a) assume page_flags = 0b1111
skip page as 0b1111 & 0b0010 = true

(b) assume page_flags = 0b1001
select page as 0b1001 & 0b0010 = false

It seemed intuitive. Right? How would you achieve same thing with negated_mask?

required_mask = PAGE_IS_WRITTEN
negated_mask = PAGE_IS_FILE
anyof_mask = PAGE_IS_PRESETNT | PAGE_IS_SWAP

(1) assume page_flags = 0b1111
tested_flags = 0b1111 ^ 0b0010 = 0b1101

(2) assume page_flags = 0b1001
tested_flags = 0b1001 ^ 0b0010 = 0b1011

In (1), we wanted to skip pages which have PAGE_IS_FILE set. But
negated_mask has just masked it and page is still getting tested if it
should be selected and it would get selected. It is wrong.

In (2), the PAGE_IS_FILE bit of page_flags was 0 and got updated to 1 or
PAGE_IS_FILE in tested_flags.
