Ah, that'd do it.  People weren't excited enough on about clone3() when
reviewing the shadow stack patches, I hadn't realised clone3() was so
new.

Right, that's my big worry - I hadn't realised it was extending as far
as musl/bionic.

Yeah, I think that's a "you broke it, you get all the pieces" thing. =20

That'd create a pretty substantial divergence with the x86 patches if
they land this time around, there's not enough time to rework them now -
I suppose it'd mainly bite people implementing libc type stuff but
still, doesn't feel great.
