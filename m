Right now, pagemap_scan_output() performs the work of both of these two
functions. The part can be broken into is_interesting_pages() and we can
leave the remaining part as it is.

Saying that n_out < n_pages tells us the buffer is full covers one case.
But there is case of maximum pages have been found and walk needs to be
aborted.

I'll just add is_interesting_page() in next version.

I wouldn't want to check if uffd is registered again and again. This is why
we are doing it only once every walk in pagemap_scan_test_walk().

Again I don't think UFFD is doing anything like this.
