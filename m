That's not my main point. It can easily become a maintenance burden

Again, that's not my main point. All I'm asking for is to separate it 
out, make it a separate flag, and include it once we have reasonable use 
cases that we are actually willing to support -- including actual data 
why it's beneficial to have.

For the single-mm use it has been shown that there are reasonable, 
existing use cases exist, and I think we are willing to support that.

This patch set is close to doubling (!) the size of mm/userfaultfd.c, 
and it already has every possible smell of maintanance nightmare IMHO. 
It does things that shouldn't be specific to some MM subsystem. I'm 
happy to see any possible complexity reduced. Moving pages between MMs 
is added complexity.

But I will stop arguing further; I hope I made my point clear and I have 
other things to work on than fighting against overly-complicated uffd 
features.

Probably, I also stumbled over a paper from 2019 that mentioned that that.

Ouch, 2020. But my comments were only regarding mshare, not MADV_DOEXEC. 
In fact, I don't even know why both discussions/threads show up as a 
single one there..

Nothing concrete, I only heard about uffd monitors that implement 
user-space based swapping. I don't recall if they require some kind of 
support from a library that gets loaded into these processes,

Same thoughts regarding CRIU using uffd.

Do you have any idea how CRIU makes that work (at least I recall that 
they wanted to use UFFD).
