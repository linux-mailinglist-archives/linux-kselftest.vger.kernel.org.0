I was thinking to get everything done at once, but it looks like we are
having some troubles, so it's good advice to separate it into small
works and upstream them on by one, Thanks.

Currently inode_getattr already takes a struct path argument in the
mainline, I would send the patches about inode_setattr refactor and
discuss the problem of file_dentry() on that thread.
