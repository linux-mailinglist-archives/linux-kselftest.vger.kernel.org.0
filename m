So for the checkpatch warning, do you want me to move the comment out
of the macro body into the kernel-doc comment? I don't really think it
is the right place for a comment of this nature, but I think it is
probably better than dropping it entirely (I don't see how else to do
it without just removing the comment entirely).

As for general readability, are you asking me to readjust all my code
in all 18 patches to fit in 75 chars? Sorry for the confusion, I am
just really surprised by this request. I thought the policy is 80
char, and reflowing all of my code in this patchset to 75 chars is not
a quick and easy thing to do. Additionally, there are some other short
term and long term issues about enforcing a 75 char limit on the KUnit
code.

Sorry, maybe I am just not understanding what you are asking me.
