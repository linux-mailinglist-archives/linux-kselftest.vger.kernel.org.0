Hum, I see, that is what I was missing. And that explain why there is
(in practice) no impact on winning the race.

I would prefer to use rcu_access_pointer() instead of
rcu_dereference_protected() to avoid pitfall, and it reflects what I was
expecting:

But I'm not sure about your proposition to move the NULL store in
release_inode() back up. Do you mean to add back the inode lock in
release_inode() like this?

I would prefer to avoid nested locks if it is not necessary though.
