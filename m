I think there is a way to avoid all these problems by switching kfunc
registration to a lazy validation model. I'll explain what I mean.

1) vmlinux_btf.ko isn't loaded by default, but kernel is aware that
there is vmlinux BTF available, if necessary.
2) when user-space tries to access /sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux, we
automatically try to load vmlinux_btf.ko; similarly, if kernel
internally needs vmlinux BTF information, we provided that
transparently through automatic loading of vmlinux_btf.ko
3a) if kernel module is loaded and it needs to register kfuncs, we
allow that, but instead of eagerly validating kfunc's associated BTF
information for correctness, we just record the fact that there is a
kfunc registered, with name ABC and associated BTF ID XYZ.
3b) when user tries to verify BPF program that needs to use kfunc ABC
from that module, that's the time when we load vmlinux_btf.ko and
validate kfunc's BTF information for correctness. If that information
is broken, report error, maybe log dmesg. If not, we are golden (and
that's the expected outcome) and we proceed with verification just
like today.

The key observation here is that with BTF there is no direct pointer
involved. It's all just stable integer IDs, so it doesn't really
matter whether we have instantiated BTF information at the kernel
module loading time or not. We can always (later) access this data
through BTF ID.

The biggest change is handling of kernel modules with broken kfuncs.
Right now we'll reject the load, because registration will fail. In
the new lazy model, this will be delayed until the very first use of
that kfunc. And if no one ever use that kfunc, it, technically,
doesn't matter. It's basically the same approach as with BPF CO-RE and
dead code elimination in verifier: if there is unknown/unsupported
code, but it's guaranteed to never execute, it's OK from the
verifier's POV.

I think that's an acceptable tradeoff, because really it's not an
expected typical situation to have such a broken module. On the other
hand, we don't need to complicate and extend BTF itself to accommodate
this, it all will works as is and will keep working in the future.

P.S. And of course all this can/should be cached, so we don't redo all
this validation, but that's just an optimization.
