As explained in my previous email, this is the only case that can realistically
happen. vDSO has no dependency on any other library (i.e. libgcc you were
mentioning) and we are referring to the fallbacks which fall in this category.

When clang is selected compat vDSOs are currently disabled on arm64, will be
introduced with a future patch series.

Anyway since I am curious as well, this is what happens with your example with
clang.8 target=arm-linux-gnueabihf:

dave-code.clang.8.o:	file format ELF32-arm-little

Disassembly of section .text:
0000000000000000 foo:
       0:	00 00 00 ef 	svc	#0
       4:	1e ff 2f e1 	bx	lr

0000000000000008 bar:
       8:	10 4c 2d e9 	push	{r4, r10, r11, lr}
       c:	08 b0 8d e2 	add	r11, sp, #8
      10:	00 40 a0 e1 	mov	r4, r0
      14:	fe ff ff eb 	bl	#-8 <bar+0xc>
      18:	00 10 a0 e1 	mov	r1, r0
      1c:	04 00 a0 e1 	mov	r0, r4
      20:	00 00 00 ef 	svc	#0
      24:	10 8c bd e8 	pop	{r4, r10, r11, pc}

Compiled with -O2, -O3, -Os never inlines.

Same thing happens for aarch64-linux-gnueabi:

dave-code.clang.8.o:	file format ELF64-aarch64-little

Disassembly of section .text:
0000000000000000 foo:
       0:	e0 03 00 2a 	mov	w0, w0
       4:	e1 03 01 2a 	mov	w1, w1
       8:	01 00 00 d4 	svc	#0
       c:	c0 03 5f d6 	ret

0000000000000010 bar:
      10:	01 0c c1 1a 	sdiv	w1, w0, w1
      14:	e0 03 00 2a 	mov	w0, w0
      18:	01 00 00 d4 	svc	#0
      1c:	c0 03 5f d6 	ret


Based on this I think we can conclude our investigation.
