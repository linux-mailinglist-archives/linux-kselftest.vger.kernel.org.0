I think that's true.

I think the former would be ideal, but the latter is acceptable as
well, assuming neither results in complaints from the compiler (I
guess we will find out for sure once we get a hold of the device tree
KUnit test).

Luis, you mentioned your linker table work might be applicable for
dynamic post boot configuring of dispatching. Do you think this work
could help solve this problem?

For reference, Alan's debugfs code can be found here:
