This case is exactly what `n_out < n_pages` will cover (if scan_output
uses max_pages properly to limit n_out).
Isn't it that when the buffer is full we want to abort the scan always
(with WP if `n_out > 0`)?

There is no need to do the checks repeatedly. If I understand the code
correctly, uffd registration is per-vma, so it can be communicated
from test_walk to entry/hole callbacks via a field in
pagemap_scan_private.

If it's cheap and easy to provide a user with a way to detect the
supported features - why not do it?
