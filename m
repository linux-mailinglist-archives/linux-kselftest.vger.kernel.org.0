What? You queue completely unreviewed stuff which touches two other
subsystems to let it soak in next?

Which has not materialized yet.

TBH, I'm pretty grumpy about those clocksource changes. Here is the
diffstat:

While the world and some more people have been CC'ed on those patches,
neither the clocksource nor the x86 maintainer have been.

When I gave Vincenzo the advise to base his code on that hyper-v branch, I
expected that I find the related patches in my mail backlog. No, they have
not been there because I was not on CC.

Folks, please stop chosing Cc lists as you like. We have well established
rules for that. And please stop queueing random unreviewed patches in
next. Next is not a playground for not ready and unreviewed stuff. No, the
hyper-v inbreed Reviewed-by is not sufficient for anything x86 and
clocksource related.

After chasing and looking at those patches, which have horrible subject
lines and changelogs btw, I was not able to judge quickly whether that
stuff is self contained or not. So no, I fixed up the fallout and rebased
Vincenzos VDSO stuff on mainline w/o those hyperv changes simply because if
they are not self contained they will break bisection badly.

I'm going to push out the VDSO series later today. That will nicely break
in combination with the hyper-next branch. Stephen, please drop that and do
not try to handle the fallout. That stuff needs to go through the proper
channels or at least be acked/reviewed by the relevant maintainers. So the
hyper-v folks can rebase themself and post it proper.

Yours grumpy,

	tglx
