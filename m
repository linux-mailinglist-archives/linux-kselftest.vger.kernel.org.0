We intentionally changed the behavior of CREDS_CHECK to be invoked only
for the final file. We are monitoring for bug reports, if we receive
complains from people that the patch breaks their expectation we will
revisit the issue.

Any LSM implementing bprm_check_security looking for brpm->cred would
be affected by recalculating the DAC credentials for the final binary.

Uhm, I can be wrong, but most LSMs calculate their state change in
bprm_creds_for_exec (git grep bprm_creds_for_exec|grep LSM_HOOK_INIT).

If I'm interpreting this behavior correctly (please any LSM maintainer
could comment on it), the intent is just to transition to a different
security context where a different set of rules could apply (since we
are executing a script).

Imagine if for every script, the security transition is based on the
interpreter, it would be hard to differentiate between scripts and
associate to the respective processes different security labels.

Definitely I lack a lot of context...

Yes, it would be really nice to fix it!

A simple example for SELinux. Suppose that the parent process has type
initrc_t, then the SELinux policy configures the following transitions
based on the label of the first file executed (sesearch -T -s initrc_t
-c process):

type_transition initrc_t NetworkManager_dispatcher_exec_t:process NetworkMa=
nager_dispatcher_t;
type_transition initrc_t NetworkManager_exec_t:process NetworkManager_t;
type_transition initrc_t NetworkManager_initrc_exec_t:process initrc_t;
type_transition initrc_t NetworkManager_priv_helper_exec_t:process NetworkM=
anager_priv_helper_t;
type_transition initrc_t abrt_dump_oops_exec_t:process abrt_dump_oops_t;
type_transition initrc_t abrt_exec_t:process abrt_t;
[...]

(there are 747 rules in my system).

If the transition would be based on the interpreter label, it would be
hard to express with rules.

If the transition does not occur for any reason the parent process
policy would still apply, but maybe it would not have the necessary
permissions for the execution of the script.

Take this with a looot of salt, if there is a TOCTOU race, the script
will be executed with a security context that does not belong to it.
But the transition already happened. Not sure if it is safe.

I also don't know how the TOCTOU race could be solved, but I also would
like it to be fixed. I'm available to comment on any proposal!
