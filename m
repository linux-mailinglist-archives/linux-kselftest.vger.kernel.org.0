+Brute
+=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
+
+Brute is a Linux Security Module that detects and mitigates fork brute fo=
rce
+attacks against vulnerable userspace processes.
+
+
+Motivation
+=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
+
+Attacks against vulnerable userspace applications with the purpose to bre=
ak ASLR
+or bypass canaries traditionally use some level of brute force with the h=
elp of
+the fork system call. This is possible since when creating a new process =
using
+fork its memory contents are the same as those of the parent process (the
+process that called the fork system call). So, the attacker can test the =
memory
+infinite times to find the correct memory values or the correct memory ad=
dresses
+without worrying about crashing the application.
+
+Based on the above scenario it would be nice to have this detected and
+mitigated, and this is the goal of this implementation. Specifically the
+following attacks are expected to be detected:
+
+ 1. Launching (fork()/exec()) a setuid/setgid process repeatedly until a
+    desirable memory layout is got (e.g. Stack Clash).
+ 2. Connecting to an exec()ing network daemon (e.g. xinetd) repeatedly un=
til a
+    desirable memory layout is got (e.g. what CTFs do for simple network
+    service).
+ 3. Launching processes without exec() (e.g. Android Zygote) and exposing=
 state
+    to attack a sibling.
+ 4. Connecting to a fork()ing network daemon (e.g. apache) repeatedly unt=
il the
+    previously shared memory layout of all the other children is exposed =
(e.g.
+    kind of related to HeartBleed).
+
+In each case, a privilege boundary has been crossed:
+
+ | Case 1: setuid/setgid process
+ | Case 2: network to local
+ | Case 3: privilege changes
+ | Case 4: network to local
+
+So, what really needs to be detected are fork/exec brute force attacks th=
at
+cross any of the commented bounds.
+
+
+Other implementations
+=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
+
+The public version of grsecurity, as a summary, is based on the idea of d=
elaying
+the fork system call if a child died due to some fatal signal (``SIGSEGV`=
`,
+``SIGBUS``, ``SIGKILL`` or ``SIGILL``). This has some issues:
+
+Bad practices
+-------------
+
+Adding delays to the kernel is, in general, a bad idea.
+
+Scenarios not detected (false negatives)
+----------------------------------------
+
+This protection acts only when the fork system call is called after a chi=
ld has
+crashed. So, it would still be possible for an attacker to fork a big amo=
unt of
+children (in the order of thousands), then probe all of them, and finally=
 wait
+the protection time before repeating the steps.
+
+Moreover, this method is based on the idea that the protection doesn't ac=
t if
+the parent crashes. So, it would still be possible for an attacker to for=
k a
+process and probe itself. Then, fork the child process and probe itself a=
gain.
+This way, these steps can be repeated infinite times without any mitigati=
on.
+
+Scenarios detected (false positives)
+------------------------------------
+
+Scenarios where an application rarely fails for reasons unrelated to a re=
al
+attack.
+
+
+This implementation
+=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D
+
+The main idea behind this implementation is to improve the existing ones
+focusing on the weak points annotated before. Basically, the adopted solu=
tion is
+to detect a fast crash rate instead of only one simple crash and to detec=
t both
+the crash of parent and child processes. Also, fine tune the detection fo=
cusing
+on privilege boundary crossing. And finally, as a mitigation method, kill=
 all
+the offending tasks involved in the attack and mark the executable as "no=
t
+allowed" (to block the following executions) instead of using delays.
+
+To achieve this goal, and going into more details, this implementation is=
 based
+on the use of some statistical data shared across all the processes that =
can
+have the same memory contents. Or in other words, a statistical data shar=
ed
+between all the fork hierarchy processes after an execve system call.
+
+The purpose of these statistics is, basically, collect all the necessary =
info to
+compute the application crash period in order to detect an attack. To tra=
ck all
+this information, the extended attributes (xattr) of the executable files=
 are
+used. More specifically, the name of the attribute is "brute" and uses th=
e
+"security" namespace. So, the full xattr name for the Brute LSM is:
+
+ ``security.brute``
+
+The same can be achieved using a pointer to the fork hierarchy statistica=
l data
+held by the ``task_struct`` structure, but this has an important drawback=
: a
+brute force attack that happens through the execve system call losts the =
faults
+info since these statistics are freed when the fork hierarchy disappears.=
 Using
+the last method (pointer in the ``task_struct`` structure) makes not poss=
ible to
+manage this attack type that can be successfully treated using extended
+attributes.
+
+To detect a brute force attack it is necessary that the statistics shared=
 by all
+the fork hierarchy processes be updated in every fatal crash and the most
+important data to update is the application crash period.
+
+The crash period is the time between two consecutive faults, but this als=
o has a
+drawback: if an application crashes twice in a short period of time for s=
ome
+reason unrelated to a real attack, a false positive will be triggered. To=
 avoid
+this scenario the exponential moving average (EMA) is used. This way, the
+application crash period will be a value that is not prone to change due =
to
+spurious data and follows the real crash period.
+
+These statistics are stored in the executables using the extended attribu=
tes
+feature. So, the detection and mitigation of brute force attacks using th=
is LSM
+it is only feasible in filesystems that support xattr.
+
+.. kernel-doc:: security/brute/brute.c
+   :identifiers: brute_raw_stats
+
+This is a fixed sized struct with a very small footprint. So, in referenc=
e to
+memory usage, it is not expected to have problems storing it as an extend=
ed
+attribute.
+
+Concerning to access rights to this statistical data, as stated above, th=
e
+"security" namespace is used. Since no custom policy, related to this ext=
ended
+attribute, has been implemented for the Brute LSM, all processes have rea=
d
+access to these statistics, and write access is limited to processes that=
 have
+the ``CAP_SYS_ADMIN`` capability.
+
+Attack detection
+----------------
+
+There are two types of brute force attacks that need to be detected. The =
first
+one is an attack that happens through the fork system call and the second=
 one is
+an attack that happens through the execve system call. Moreover, these tw=
o
+attack types have two variants. A slow brute force attack that is detecte=
d if a
+maximum number of faults per fork hierarchy is reached and a fast brute f=
orce
+attack that is detected if the application crash period falls below a cer=
tain
+threshold.
+
+Attack mitigation
+-----------------
+
+Once an attack has been detected, this is mitigated killing all the offen=
ding
+tasks involved. Or in other words, once an attack has been detected, this=
 is
+mitigated killing all the processes that are executing the same file that=
 is
+running during the brute force attack. Also, to prevent the executable in=
volved
+in the attack from being respawned by a supervisor, and thus prevent a br=
ute
+force attack from being started again, the file is marked as "not allowed=
" and
+the following executions are avoided based on this mark. This method allo=
ws
+supervisors to implement their own policy: they can read the statistics, =
know if
+the executable is blocked by the Brute LSM and why, and act based on this
+information. If they want to respawn the offending executable it is only
+necessary to remove the "``security.brute``" extended attribute and thus =
remove
+the statistical data.
+
+Fine tuning the attack detection
+--------------------------------
+
+To avoid false positives during the attack detection it is necessary to n=
arrow
+the possible cases. To do so, and based on the threat scenarios that we w=
ant to
+detect, this implementation also focuses on the crossing of privilege bou=
nds.
+
+To be precise, only the following privilege bounds are taken into account=
:
+
+ 1. setuid/setgid process
+ 2. network to local
+ 3. privilege changes
+
+Moreover, only the fatal signals delivered by the kernel are taken into a=
ccount
+avoiding the fatal signals sent by userspace applications (with the excep=
tion of
+the ``SIGABRT`` user signal since this is used by glibc for stack canary,
+malloc, etc. failures, which may indicate that a mitigation has been trig=
gered).
+
+Userspace notification via waitid() system call
+-----------------------------------------------
+
+Although the xattr of the executable is accessible from userspace, in com=
plex
+daemons this file may not be visible directly by the supervisor as it may=
 be run
+through some wrapper. So, an extension to the ``waitid()`` system call ha=
s been
+added.
+
+ ``int waitid(idtype_t idtype, id_t id, siginfo_t *infop, int options);``
+
+Upon successful return, ``waitid()`` fills in the ``siginfo_t`` structure
+pointed to by ``infop``, but now, the ``si_code`` field can be:
+
+ ``CLD_BRUTE``: child was killed by brute LSM. Defined as value 7.
+
+in addition to the following codes:
+
+ | ``CLD_EXITED``: child has called exit. Defined as value 1.
+ | ``CLD_KILLED``: child was killed by signal. Defined as value 2.
+ | ``CLD_DUMPED``: child terminated abnormally. Defined as value 3.
+ | ``CLD_TRAPPED``: traced child has trapped. Defined as value 4.
+ | ``CLD_STOPPED``: child has stopped. Defined as value 5.
+ | ``CLD_CONTINUED``: stopped child has continued. Defined as value 6.
+
+Exponential moving average (EMA)
+--------------------------------
+
+This kind of average defines a weight (between 0 and 1) for the new value=
 to add
+and applies the remainder of the weight to the current average value. Thi=
s way,
+some spurious data will not excessively modify the average and only if th=
e new
+values are persistent, the moving average will tend towards them.
+
+Mathematically the application crash period's EMA can be expressed as fol=
lows:
+
+ period_ema =3D period * weight + period_ema * (1 - weight)
+
+Related to the attack detection, the EMA must guarantee that not many cra=
shes
+are needed. To demonstrate this, the scenario where an application has fa=
iled
+and then has been running without any crashes for a month, will be used.
+
+The period's EMA can be written now as:
+
+ period_ema[i] =3D period[i] * weight + period_ema[i - 1] * (1 - weight)
+
+If the new crash periods have insignificant values related to the first c=
rash
+period (a month in this case), the formula can be rewritten as:
+
+ period_ema[i] =3D period_ema[i - 1] * (1 - weight)
+
+And by extension:
+
+ | period_ema[i - 1] =3D period_ema[i - 2] * (1 - weight)
+ | period_ema[i - 2] =3D period_ema[i - 3] * (1 - weight)
+ | period_ema[i - 3] =3D period_ema[i - 4] * (1 - weight)
+
+So, if the substitution is made:
+
+ | period_ema[i] =3D period_ema[i - 1] * (1 - weight)
+ | period_ema[i] =3D period_ema[i - 2] * (1 - weight)\ :sup:`2`
+ | period_ema[i] =3D period_ema[i - 3] * (1 - weight)\ :sup:`3`
+ | period_ema[i] =3D period_ema[i - 4] * (1 - weight)\ :sup:`4`
+
+And in a more generic form:
+
+ period_ema[i] =3D period_ema[i - n] * (1 - weight)\ :sup:`n`
+
+Where "n" represents the number of iterations to obtain an EMA value. Or =
in
+other words, the number of crashes to detect an attack.
+
+So, if we isolate the number of crashes:
+
+ | period_ema[i] / period_ema[i - n] =3D (1 - weight)\ :sup:`n`
+ | log(period_ema[i] / period_ema[i - n]) =3D log((1 - weight)\ :sup:`n`)
+ | log(period_ema[i] / period_ema[i - n]) =3D n * log(1 - weight)
+ | n =3D log(period_ema[i] / period_ema[i - n]) / log(1 - weight)
+
+Then, in the commented scenario (an application has failed and then has b=
een
+running without any crashes for a month), the approximate number of crash=
es to
+detect an attack (using the default implementation values for the weight =
and the
+crash period threshold) is:
+
+ | weight =3D 7 / 10
+ | crash_period_threshold =3D 30 seconds
+
+ | n =3D log(crash_period_threshold / seconds_per_month) / log(1 - weight=
)
+ | n =3D log(30 / (30 * 24 * 3600)) / log(1 - 0.7)
+ | n =3D 9.44
+
+So, with 10 crashes for this scenario an attack will be detected. If thes=
e steps
+are repeated for different scenarios and the results are collected:

+
+However, this computation has a drawback. The first data added to the EMA=
 not
+obtains a real average showing a trend. So the solution is simple, the EM=
A needs
+a minimum number of data to be able to be interpreted. This way, the case=
 where
+a few first faults are fast enough followed by no crashes is avoided.
+
+Per system enabling/disabling
+-----------------------------
+
+This feature can be enabled at build time using the
+``CONFIG_SECURITY_FORK_BRUTE`` option or using the visual config applicat=
ion
+under the following menu:
+
+ Security options  ``--->`` Fork brute force attack detection and mitigat=
ion
+
+Also, at boot time, this feature can be disable too, by changing the "``l=
sm=3D``"
+boot parameter.
+
+Per system configuration
+------------------------
+
+To customize the detection's sensibility there are five new sysctl attrib=
utes
+for the Brute LSM that are accessible through the following path:
+
+ ``/proc/sys/kernel/brute/``
+
+More specifically, the files and their description are:
+
+**ema_weight_numerator**
+
+ .. kernel-doc:: security/brute/brute.c
+    :doc: brute_ema_weight_numerator
+
+**ema_weight_denominator**

+Kernel selftests
+----------------
+
+To validate all the expectations about this implementation, there is a se=
t of
+selftests. This tests cover fork/exec brute force attacks crossing the fo=
llowing
+privilege boundaries:
+
+ 1. setuid process
+ 2. privilege changes
+ 3. network to local
+
+Also, there are some tests to check that fork/exec brute force attacks wi=
thout
+crossing any privilege boundary already commented doesn't trigger the det=
ection
+and mitigation stage. Moreover, a test to verify the userspace notificati=
on via
+the ``waitid()`` system call has also been added.
+
+To build the tests:
+ ``make -C tools/testing/selftests/ TARGETS=3Dbrute``
+
+To run the tests:
+ ``make -C tools/testing/selftests TARGETS=3Dbrute run_tests``
+
+To package the tests:
+ ``make -C tools/testing/selftests TARGETS=3Dbrute gen_tar``
