Good point.  I agree that using "ok 0 <something>" to define the prefix
string or metadata is a terrible hack.  (This was alternative 2 above.)

Let's tag that as "alternative 3".  So far, I like alternative 3 the most.

Alternative 3 has some impact on diagnostic lines.  KTAP v1 allows diagnostic
lines to occur anywhere.  I we leave that unchanged, then I think that any
metadata tag (such as "Name: ", "File: ", "Config: " in the above example)
should be made illegal in other diagnostic lines.  I don't like the idea
of restricting diagnostic line format in that matter, so I would instead
propose instead restricting non-metadata diagnostic lines to not be allowed
between the version line and the test plan line.  I don't think that
restriction would be problematic.

Alternative 3 also provides a clean way of implementing test name.  Also,
changing from subtest name to test name is a good cleanup.  Since the
name could be for the top level test, using "subtest" adds a conceptual
mismatch for the main test name.

Yes, I goofed up on that.  The same applies to the following
