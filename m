I appreciate it's frustrating for you, but this is the nature of
patch review.  I haven't even read the first five or so submissions.
I can see them in my inbox and they look like long threads.  I'm not
particularly inclined to read them.  I happened to read v6, and reacted
to the API being ugly.

You've gone about this in entirely the wrong way though.  This enum to
read the entire file or a partial is just bad design.

Does pread() in userspace take seven parameters?  No.  It takes four.
What you're doing is taking all the complexity of all of the interfaces
and stuffing it all down into the bottom function instead of handling
some of the complexity in the wrapper functions.  For example, you
could support the functionality of 'max_size' in kernel_read_file()
and leave it out of the kernel_pread_file() interface.

That's the point.  It doesn't.  If a caller needs that, then they can
figure that out themselves.

You're trying to build the swiss army knife of functions.  Swiss army
knives are useful, but they're no good for carving a steak.

You know, you haven't even said _why_ you want this.  The cover letter
just says "I want this", and doesn't say why it's needed.
