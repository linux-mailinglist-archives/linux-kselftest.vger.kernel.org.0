Some questions (and request to document the answers) as we now allow to 
have unmovable allocations all over the place and I don't see a single 
comment regarding that in the cover letter:

1. How will the issue of plenty of unmovable allocations for user space 
be tackled in the future?

2. How has this issue been documented? E.g., interaction with 
ZONE_MOVABLE and CMA, alloc_conig_range()/alloc_contig_pages?.

3. How are the plans to support migration in the future and which 
interface changes will be required? (Michal mentioned some good points 
to make this configurable via the interface, we should plan ahead and 
document)

Thanks!
