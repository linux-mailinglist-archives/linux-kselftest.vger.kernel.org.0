It can be problem for both. If you have just too much of shm (do not
forget about MAP_SHARED|MAP_ANON which is much harder to size from an
admin POV) then migrateability doesn't really help because you need a
free memory to migrate. Without reclaimability this can easily become a
problem. That is why I am saying this is not really a new problem.
Swapless systems are not all that uncommon.

yes, you are right of course and I am not really disputing this. But I
would argue that 2:1 Movable/Normal is something to expect problems
already. "Lowmem" allocations can easily trigger OOM even without secret
mem in the picture. It all just takes to allocate a lot of GFP_KERNEL or
even GFP_{HIGH}USER. Really, it is CMA/MOVABLE that are elephant in the
room and one has to be really careful when relying on them.

Well, if we had a proper user space pinning accounting then I would
agree that there is a better model to use. But we don't. And previous
attempts to achieve that have failed. So I am afraid that we do not have
much choice left than using mlock as a model.

yeah I do agree that pinning is a problem for movable/CMA but most
people simply do not care about those. Movable is the thing for hoptlug
and a really weird fragmentation avoidance IIRC and CMA is mostly to
handle crap HW. If those are to be used along with secret mem or
longterm GUP then they will constantly bump into corner cases. Do not
take me wrong, we should be looking at those problems, we should even
document them but I do not see this as anything new. We should probably
have a central place in Documentation explaining all those problems. I
would be even happy to see an explicit note in the tunables - e.g.
configuring movable/normal in 2:1 will get you back to 32b times wrt.
low mem problems.
