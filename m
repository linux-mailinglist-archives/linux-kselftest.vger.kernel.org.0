This is on the order of a few MB at most.

Some of these images are current 250MB.Â  At we anticipate them growing 
to 512MB.
And, we do have systems with the driver loading 16 cards in parallel 
with no requirement that they are the same images
(although loading 16 different images to 16 different cards would be 
strange but possible).

I thought this was addressed in patch v6 "ima: aad FIRMWARE_PARTIAL_READ 
support"
https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/6/5/1126
(although implementation not to your liking in current review)?

I don't understand what you are staying here: I am request a partial 
firmware read into a buf.
At the time the partial firmware is read into a buf it is validated by 
the security module if such integrity checks are enabled.
If, at another time I wish to request another partial firmware into a 
buffer (could be the same part of the file or a different part of a file 
or from another file), the integrity check is performed again and the 
portion of the file I request should be put into the buffer.
If a lock on a file is needed by somebody between these partial reads 
that is a different API and out of the scope of my patch series.

Thanks at least for helping with guidance, I see your review is thought 
out and
hopefully we can come to a conclusion as I feel we are fairly close with 
your changes.

Yes, terribly inefficient, but if somebody wants to do some optimization 
they are welcome to it.
In fact, I want to call a partial read of a file with NO security. Can I 
add such a call instead?
If we did that now then the inefficient read of the file multiple times 
to authenticate it each time wouldn't be introduced.
In my use case the linux kernel security on the file is quite 
meaningless and a waste of time to even perform.
Whether the file has been compromised, corrupt or otherwise the image is 
validated by the hardware after
the image is loaded to the card to ensure it passes authentication.

I see your cleanup and merged with it.Â  Will need to test everything again.

I obviously am not aware of all of the security hooks and architecture
in place but I do see your cleanups as a simplification over what was there.
