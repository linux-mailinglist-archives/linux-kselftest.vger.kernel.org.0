How guest would operate on VMAs if the interface between host and guest is
virtual hardware?

If you mean qemu (or any other userspace part of VMM that uses KVM), so one
of the points Andy mentioned back than is to remove mappings of the guest
memory from the qemu process.

Citing my older email:

    I've hesitated whether to continue to use new flags to memfd_create() or to
    add a new system call and I've decided to use a new system call after I've
    started to look into man pages update. There would have been two completely
    independent descriptions and I think it would have been very confusing.

Mike.
