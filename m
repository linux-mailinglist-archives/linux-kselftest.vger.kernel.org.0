I would really like to see the mask discussed will be adopted. With it CRIU=
 will
be able to migrate huge sparse VMAs assuming that a single hole is processe=
d in=20
O(1) time.=20

Use cases for migrating sparse VMAs are binaries sanitized with ASAN, MSAN =
or
TSAN [1]. All of these sanitizers produce sparse mappings of shadow memory =
[2].
Being able to migrate such binaries allows to highly reduce the amount of w=
ork
needed to identify and fix post-migration crashes, which happen constantly.

Plus one for page_region data structure. It will make ASAN shadow memory
representation much more compact as well as any other classical use-case.=
