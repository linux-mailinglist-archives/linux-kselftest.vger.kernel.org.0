Passing a struct larger than a PAGE_SIZE right now (at least for all
those calls that would make use of this helper at the moment) is to be
considered a bug.
The PAGE_SIZE check is a reasonable heuristic. It's an assumption that
is pretty common in the kernel in other places as well. Plus the
possibility of DoS.

I think the order you have right now is fine. I don't see the point of
doing work first before we have verified that things are sane.
