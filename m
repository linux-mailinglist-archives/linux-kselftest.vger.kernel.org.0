I have to correct myself. IMHO, the deadlock is far from obvious. I
always get lost in the code and the documentation is not clear.

IMHO, the problem is actually with kobject_del() that gets blocked
until the sysfs interface gets removed. kobject_put() will have
the same problem only when the clean up is not delayed.

The rule "do not share locks between a module removal and a sysfs
operation" is not clear to me.

IMHO, there are the following rules:

1. rule: kobject_del() or kobject_put() must not be called under a lock that
	 is used by store()/show() callbacks.

   reason: kobject_del() waits until the sysfs interface is destroyed.
	 It has to wait until all store()/show() callbacks are finished.


2. rule: kobject_del()/kobject_put() must not be called from the
	related store() callbacks.

   reason: same as in 1st rule.


3. rule: module_exit() must wait until all release() callbacks are called
	 when kobject are static.

   reason: kobject_put() must be called to clean up internal
	dependencies. The clean up might be done asynchronously
	and need access to the kobject structure.

PS: I am sorry if I am messing things. I want to be sure that we are
    all talking about the same and understand it the same way.
