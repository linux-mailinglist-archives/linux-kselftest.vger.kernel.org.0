I picked up the core implementation and the ARM64 and x86 conversion. I did
some refinements in several places, coding style, naming conventions,
comments and changelogs including subject prefixes. Please double check!

I did not merge the ARM and MIPS parts as they lack any form of
acknowlegment from their maintainers. Please talk to those folks. If they
ack/review the changes then I can pick them up and they go into 5.3 or they
have to go in a later cycle. Nevertheless it was well worth the trouble to
have those conversions done to confirm that the new common library fits a
bunch of different architectures.

As you can see from the commit dates, this has soaked for some time in a
WIP branch and I did extensive regression testing. So far so good.

Thanks a lot for going through several iterations. It's a very much
appreciated effort!

Especially with the upcoming time namespaces this will avoid a lot of
duplicated and pointlessly different horrors all over the architecture
space. Any architecture which wants to gain that support needs to convert
to the generic VDSO first.

As you have become the dude who knows almost everything about VDSO
including all the nasty pitfalls, I propose the patch below.

Thanks,

	tglx

Asign the following folks in alphabetic order:

 - Andy for being the VDSO wizard of x86 and in general. He's also the
   performance monitor of choice and the code in the generic library is
   heavily influenced by his previous x86 VDSO work.

 - Thomas for being the dude who has to deal with any form of time(r)
   nonsense anyway

 - Vincenzo for being the poor sod who went through all the different
   architecture implementations in order to unify them. A lot of knowledge
   gained from VDSO implementation details to the intricacies of taming the
   build system.
