A general comment simply because I realized that just now: does anything 
speak against limiting the operations now to a single MM?

The use cases I heard so far don't need it. If ever required, we could 
consider extending it.

Let's reduce complexity and KIS unless really required.


Further: see "22) Do not crash the kernel" in coding-style.rst. All 
these BUG_ON need to go. Ideally, use WARN_ON_ONCE() or just VM_WARN_ON().
