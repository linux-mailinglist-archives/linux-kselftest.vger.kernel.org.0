Please separate that part out from the other changes; I am still not 
convinced that we want this and what the semantical implications are.

Let's take a look at an example: can_change_pte_writable()

	/* Do we need write faults for softdirty tracking? */
	if (vma_soft_dirty_enabled(vma) && !pte_soft_dirty(pte))
		return false;

We care about PTE softdirty tracking, if it is enabled for the VMA. 
Tracking is enabled if: vma_soft_dirty_enabled()

	/*
	 * Soft-dirty is kind of special: its tracking is enabled when
	 * the vma flags not set.
	 */
	return !(vma->vm_flags & VM_SOFTDIRTY);

Consequently, if VM_SOFTDIRTY is set, we are not considering the 
soft_dirty PTE bits accordingly.


I'd suggest moving forward without this controversial 
PAGEMAP_NO_REUSED_REGIONS functionality for now, and preparing it as a 
clear add-on we can discuss separately.
