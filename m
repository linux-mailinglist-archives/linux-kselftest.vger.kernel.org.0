I'm not sure why do we want uniformity in the case of 1 flag? If a
user specifies a single required flag, I'd expect he doesn't need to
look at the flags returned as those will duplicate the information
from mere presence of a page. A user might also require a single flag,
but want all of them returned. Both requests - return 1 flag and
return 0 flags would give meaningful output, so why force one way or
the other? Allowing two will also enable users to express the intent:
they need either just a list of pages, or they need a list with
per-page flags - the need would follow from the code structure or
other factors.

I require flags PAGE_IS_WRITTEN=3D1, PAGE_IS_FILE=3D0, so:

required_mask =3D PAGE_IS_WRITTEN | PAGE_IS_FILE;
negated_flags =3D PAGE_IS_FILE; // flags I want zero

I also require one of PAGE_IS_PRESENT=3D1 or PAGE_IS_SWAP=3D1, so:

anyof_mask =3D PAGE_IS_PRESENT | PAGE_IS_SWAP;

Another case: I want to analyse a process' working set:

required_mask =3D 0;
negated_flags =3D PAGE_IS_FILE;
anyof_mask =3D PAGE_IS_FILE | PAGE_IS_WRITTEN;

-> gathering pages modified [WRITTEN=3D1] or not backed by a file [FILE=3D0=
].

To clarify a bit: negated_flags doesn't mask anything: the field
inverts values of the flags (marks some "active low", if you consider
electronic signal analogy).
