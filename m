Hi Luis,

Thanks for the review.

I did not think this patch would be the final solution either

as indicated in the original cover letter and code comment.

Some comments inline.

To be honest, I find the entire firmware code sloppy.  I don't think the 
cache/no-cache feature is

implemented or tested properly nor fallback to begin with.  I'm not 
claiming this patch is the final

solution and indicated such in the cover letter and the comment above.

I hope there is someone more familiar with this code to comment further 
and come up with a proper solution.


I have found numerous issues and race conditions with the firmware code 
(I simply added a test).

1) Try loading the same valid firmware using no-cache once it has 
already been loaded with cache.

It won't work, which is why I had to use a different filename in the 
test for request_firmware_into_buf.

2) Try removing the "if (opt_flags & FW_OPT_NOCACHE)" in my patch and 
always call the mutex.

The firmware test will lock up during a "no uevent" test.  I am not 
familiar with the code to

know why such is true and what issue this exposes in the code.

3) I have a driver that uses request_firmware_into_buf and have multiple 
instances of the driver

loading the same firmware in parallel.  Some of the data is not read 
correctly in each instance.

I haven't yet to reproduce this issue with the firmware test but 
currently have a mutex around the entire

call to request_firmware_into_buf in our driver.


Perhaps it is better at this point to add a mutex in 
request_firmware_into_buf to make is entirely safe?

(Perhaps even with every request_firmware functions as none seems to be 
tested properly.)

Or, add a new function called safe_request_firmware_into_buf with such 
mutex to protect the function.

The current racey request_firmware functions could then be left alone 
and those who want reliable

firmware loading can use the safe calls?
