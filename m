I think I commented on this before. I agree with the statement that
there is no overlap between Kselftest and KUnit. I would like see this
removed. Kselftest module support supports use-cases KUnit won't be able
to. I can build an kernel with Kselftest test modules and use it in the
filed to load and run tests if I need to debug a problem and get data
from a system. I can't do that with KUnit.

In my mind, I am not viewing this as which is better. Kselftest and
KUnit both have their place in the kernel development process. It isn't
productive and/or necessary to comparing Kselftest and KUnit without a
good understanding of the problem spaces for each of these.

I would strongly recommend not making reference to Kselftest and talk
about what KUnit offers.

Again, unnecessary. KUnit can't replace Kselftest module in the way
Kselftest module support can be used for debugging and gathering
information on system that might be in active use and not dedicated
to test and development alone. I wouldn't hesitate loading a Kselftest
test module on my laptop and running tests, but I wouldn't use KUnit
the same way.

Again, this is not a competition between which is better. Kselftest
and KUnit serve different needs and problem spaces.

Please redo this documentation to reflect that.

thanks,
