I dunno, "hardware enforced" can also mean worse security nowadays ;)

But seriously, I think the question is more about what this brings us
*on top of* SCS, since for the forseeable future folks that care about
this stuff (like Android) will be using SCS. GCS on its own doesn't make
sense to me, given the recompilation effort to remove SCS and the lack
of hardware, so then you have to look at what it brings in addition to
GCS and balance that against the performance cost.

Given that, is anybody planning to ship a distribution with this enabled?
If not, why are we bothering? If so, how much of that distribution has
been brought up and how does the "dynamic linker or other startup code"
decide what to do?

After the mess we had with BTI and mprotect(), I'm hesitant to merge
features like this without knowing that the ABI can stand real code.
