Hello Andrei and Danylo,

The interface and implementation has been updated. I've exposed file, 
present and swap bit with masks. I've tested soft-dirty PTE bits 
thoroughly throughly through the selftest. I've only a few test cases 
related to file/preset/swap bits. Can you guys test it as well? The 
selftest contains several examples on how to use the interface and test.

Thanks,
Usama
