I tried to dig the regression report in the mailing list, and the best I
could find is

https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20190823052335.572133-1-songliubraving@fb.com/

which does not mention the actual performance regression but it only
complaints about kernel text mapping being split into 4K pages.

Any chance you have the regression report handy?

This commit talks about large page split for the text and mentions iTLB
performance.
Could it be that for data the behavoiur is different?

I understand that the benchmark should stress the TLB, but it's not that
we can add something like random access to a large working set as a
kernel module and insmod it. The userspace should do something that will
cause the stress to the TLB so that entries corresponding to the direct
map will be evicted frequently. And, frankly,

The standard error for those are between 2.5 and 4.5 out of 3 runs for
each variant. 

For kernel build 1G mappings perform better, but here 5s is only 1.6% of
300s and the direct map fragmentation was taken to the extreme here.
I'm not saying that the direct map fragmentation comes with no cost, but
the cost is not so big to dismiss features that cause the fragmentation
out of hand.

There were also benchmarks that actually performed better with 2M pages
in the direct map, so I'm still not convinced that 1G pages in the
direct map are the clear cut winner.
