Not directly no.

A device_del() *can* happen in other areas other than module exit sure,
but the issue is if a shared lock is used *before* device_del() and also
used on a sysfs op. Typically this can happen on module exit, and the
other common use case in my experience is on sysfs ops, such is the case
with the zram driver. Both cases are covered then by this fix.

If there are other areas, that is still driver specific, but of the
things we *can* generalize, definitely module exit is a common path.

I only really seriously considered trying to generalize this after it
was hinted to me live patching was also affected, and so clearly
something generic was desirable.

There may be other drivers for sure, but a hunt for that with semantics
would require a bit complex coccinelle patch with iteration support.

> Why can't we fix the exact driver?

You can try, the way the lock is used in zram is correct, specially
after my other fix in this series which addresses another unrelated bug
with cpu hotplug multistate support. So we then can proceed to either
take the position to say: "Thou shalt not use a shared lock on module
exit and a sysfs op" and try to fix all places, or we generalize a fix
for this. A generic fix seems more desirable.
