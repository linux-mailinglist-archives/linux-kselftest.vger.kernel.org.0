That is more or less the current plan. As detailed below, HK_TYPE_DOMAIN 
& HK_TYPE_WQ isolation are included in the isolated partitions by 
default. I am also thinking about including other relatively cheap 
isolation flags by default. The expensive ones will have to be enabled 
via isolation_full.

Well, the process of first moving the CPUs offline first is rather 
expensive. I won't mind doing some partial offlining based on the 
existing set of teardown and bringup callbacks, but I would try to avoid 
fully offlining the CPUs first.

HK_TYPE_DOMAIN is already available via the current cpuset isolated 
partition functionality. What I am currently doing is to extend that to 
other HK_TYPE* flags.

HK_TYPE_WQ is basically done and it is going to work properly with the 
workqueue affinity sysfs files. From the workqueue of view, HK_TYPE_WQ 
is currently treated the same as HK_TYPE_DOMAIN.

I don't think HK_FLAG_SCHED is being used at all. So I believe we should 
remove it to avoid confusion.

Yes, isolation_full applies only to isolated partitions. It extends the 
amount of CPU isolation by enabling all the other CPU available 
isolation flags.
