Ah, now I see what you are saying. Yes, I could pass in what it is
suppose to call. But I was trying to use the same code for all the
alternative solutions we were passing around, and this became the
"default" case that would work with any int3_emulate_call
implementation we came up with.

That is, if we call ftrace_regs_caller() for any scenario it should
work. Even if the call was suppose to be a nop, because in that case,
all the ftrace_ops registered in the iterator would refuse to have
their handler be called for that function.

I sent you a single patch, but that was really just a diff of several
applied patches against your unmodified tree. The last patch implements
the ftrace code. And I had it this way because it should work for any
of the implementations.

I could modify it so that it picks what function to call when the int3
is triggered. I think all the solutions we are down to allow that now.
Some of the early ideas had me call one function for all int3s due to
trampolines and such.

Also, I figured just calling ftrace_regs_caller() was simpler then
having that int3 handler do the hash look ups to determine what handler
it needs to call.
