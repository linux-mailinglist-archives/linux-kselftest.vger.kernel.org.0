Hi Kees,

You and others are certainly more experts in the filesystem and security
infrastructure of the kernel.
What I am trying to accomplish is a simple operation:
request part of a file into a buffer rather than the whole file.
If someone could add such support I would be more than happy to use it.

This has now bubbled into many other designs issues in the existing 
codebase.
I will need more details on your comments - see below.

Does your patch series "Fix misused kernel_read_file() enums" handle this
because this suggestion is outside the scope of my change?

It does not appear there is any user of partial reads of kexec images?
I have been informed by Greg K-H to not add apis that are not used so 
such support
doesn't make sense to add at this time.

The addition I am adding is for request_partial_firmware_into_buf.
In order to do so it adds internal support for partial reads of firmware 
files,
not kexec image.

The above seems outside the scope of my patch?

The request is for a partial read.  IMA ensures the whole file integrity 
even though I only do a partial read.
The next partial read will re-read and check integrity of file.

The file will be reopened and integrity checked on the next partial read 
(if there is one).
So I don't think there is any change to be made here.
If writes aren't already disabled for a whole file read then that is 
something that needs to be fixed in the existing code.

I used existing infrastructure provided by Mimi but now looks like it 
will have to fit with your patches from yesterday.

It's no different than a full file read so no change to be made here.
> - make the "full read" happen as part of the first partial read so the

Each partial read is an individual operation so I think a "full read" is 
performed every time
if your security IMA is enabled.  If someone wants to add a file lock 
and then partial reads in the kernel
then that would be different than what is needed by the kernel driver.
