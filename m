Right now we have:

pagemap_scan_output():
	if (p->vec_buf_index >= p->vec_buf_len)
		return PM_SCAN_BUFFER_FULL;
	if (p->found_pages == p->max_pages)
		return PM_SCAN_FOUND_MAX_PAGES;

pagemap_scan_pmd_entry():
	ret = pagemap_scan_output(bitmap, p, start, n_pages);
	if (ret >= 0) // success
		make_UFFD_WP and flush
	else
		buffer_error

You are asking me to do:

pagemap_scan_output():
	if (p->vec_buf_index >= p->vec_buf_len)
		return 0;
	if (p->found_pages == p->max_pages)
		return PM_SCAN_FOUND_MAX_PAGES;

pagemap_scan_pmd_entry():
	ret = pagemap_scan_output(bitmap, p, start, n_pages);
	if (ret > 0) // success
		make_UFFD_WP and flush
	else if (ret == 0) // buffer full
		return PM_SCAN_BUFFER_FULL;	
	else //other errors
		buffer_error

So you are asking me to go from consie code to write more lines of code. I
would write more lines without any issue if it improves readability and
logical sense. But I don't see here any benefit.

We are making things more and more complex. I don't like multi-plexing
variables. Can you give examples where multi-plexing has been done on
variables inside linux kernel? Muti-plexing means user gives input and
takes output from same variable. It makes variable double meaning.
