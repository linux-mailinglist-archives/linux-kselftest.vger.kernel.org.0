I think there is a misunderstanding. For this syscall I wasn't talking
about the "options" field but about the "handled_access_fs" field which
has 14 bits dedicated to control access to the file system:
https://landlock.io/linux-doc/landlock-v19/security/landlock/user.html#filesystem-flags
The idea is to add other handled_access_* fields for other kernel object
types (e.g. network, process, etc.).

The "options" field is fine as a raw __u32 syscall argument.

There was multiple discussions about ABI compatibility, especially
inspired by open(2) vs. openat2(2), and ignoring flags seems to be a bad
idea. In the "sandboxer" example, we first probe the supported features
and then mask unknown bits (i.e. access rights) at run time in userland.
This strategy is quite straightforward, backward compatible and
future-proof.

What does the linux-api folks think about this?

Right, but this is a special case (i.e. best-effort security, not a
required feature to run an application properly). As previously
discussed, this kind of security feature should be used as much as
possible by userland, but it may run on a system without Landlock. To
encourage a wide use of this kind of security sandboxing by userland
developers we should avoid the case when all the sandboxing is disabled
because not all sandboxing features are supported by the running kernel.

I agree that it is not perfect with the current tools but this kind of
extensible structs are becoming common and well defined (e.g. openat2).
Moreover there is some work going on for seccomp to support "extensible
argument" syscalls: https://lwn.net/Articles/822256/

I don't know how many rule types will come, but right now I think it may
be less than 10.

I don't think so, file path and network addresses are an example of very
different types.

OK, makes sense, I'll try to follow this as much as possible then.
