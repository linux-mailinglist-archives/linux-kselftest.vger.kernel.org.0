You are missing the optimization here that we check for full buffer every
time adding to user buffer. This was added to remove extra iteration of
page walk if buffer is full already. The way you are suggesting will remove it.

So you are returning remaining pages to be found now. This doesn't seem
right. If max_pages is 520, found_pages is 0 and n_pages is 512 before
calling pagemap_scan_output(). found_pages would become 512 after adding
512 pages to output buffer. But n_pages would return 8 instead of 512. You
were saying we should return the number of pages added to the output buffer.
