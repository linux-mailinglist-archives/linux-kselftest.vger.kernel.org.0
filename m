I get your point, it's similar but still different. "no memory in the 
system" vs. "plenty of unusable free memory available in the system".

In many setups, memory for user space applications can go to 
ZONE_MOVABLE just fine. ZONE_NORMAL etc. can be used for supporting user 
space memory (e.g., page tables) and other kernel stuff.

Like, have 4GB of ZONE_MOVABLE with 2GB of ZONE_NORMAL. Have an 
application (database) that allocates 4GB of memory. Works just fine. 
The zone ratio ends up being a problem for example with many processes 
(-> many page tables).

Not being able to put user space memory into the movable zone is a 
special case. And we are introducing yet another special case here 
(besides vfio, rdma, unmigratable huge pages like gigantic pages).

With plenty of secretmem, looking at /proc/meminfo Total vs. Free can be 
a big lie of how your system behaves.

Right, it's all about what the setup actually needs. Sure, there are 
cases where you need significantly more GFP_KERNEL/GFP_{HIGH}USER such 
that a 2:1 ratio is not feasible. But I claim that these are corner cases.

Secretmem gives user space the option to allocate a lot of 
GFP_{HIGH}USER memory. If I am not wrong, "ulimit -a" tells me that each 
application on F33 can allocate 16 GiB (!) of secretmem.

Which other ways do you know where random user space can do something 
similar? I'd be curious what other scenarios there are where user space 
can easily allocate a lot of unmovable memory.

Yes, I agree.

Exactly.

In most setups, ratios of 1:1 up to 4:1 work reasonably well. Of course, 
it's not applicable to all setups (obviously).

For example, oVirt has been using ratios of 3:1 for a long time. (online 
all memory to ZONE_MOVABLE in the guest, never hotplug more than 3x boot 
memory size). Most distros end up onlining all hotplugged memory on bare 
metal to ZONE_MOVABLE, and I've seen basically no bug reports related to 
that.

Highmem was a little different, yet similar. RHEL provided the bigmem 
kernel with ratios of 60:4, which worked in many setups. The main 
difference to highmem was that e.g., pagetables could be placed onto it. 
So ratios like 18:1 are completely insane with ZONE_MOVABLE.

I am constantly trying to fight for making more stuff MOVABLE instead of 
going into the other direction (e.g., because it's easier to implement, 
which feels like the wrong direction).

Maybe I am the only person that really cares about ZONE_MOVABLE these 
days :) I can't stop such new stuff from popping up, so at least I want 
it to be documented.
