tl;dr: I like this series, I think there are number of clarifications

In my first read through, I didn't see how cross-userspace operations
were blocked, but it looks like it's the various gup paths where
{vma,page}_is_secretmem() is called. (Thank you for the self-test! That
helped me follow along.) I think this access pattern should be more
clearly spelled out in the cover later (i.e. "This will block things
like process_vm_readv()").

I like the results (inaccessible outside the process), though I suspect
this will absolutely melt gdb or other ptracers that try to see into
the memory. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of such concepts[0], but
I see nothing in the cover letter about it (e.g. the effects on "ptrace"
or "gdb" are not mentioned.)

There is also a risk here of this becoming a forensics nightmare:
userspace malware will just download their entire executable region
into a memfd_secret region. Can we, perhaps, disallow mmap/mprotect
with PROT_EXEC when vma_is_secretmem()? The OpenSSL example, for
example, certainly doesn't need PROT_EXEC.

What's happening with O_CLOEXEC in this code? I don't see that mentioned
in the cover letter either. Why is it disallowed? That seems a strange
limitation for something trying to avoid leaking secrets into other
processes.

And just so I'm sure I understand: if a vma_is_secretmem() check is
missed in future mm code evolutions, it seems there is nothing to block
the kernel from accessing the contents directly through copy_from_user()
via the userspace virtual address, yes?

As for protecting against exploited kernel flaws I also see benefits
here. While the kernel is already blocked from directly reading contents
from userspace virtual addresses (i.e. SMAP), this feature does help by
blocking the kernel from directly reading contents via the direct map
alias. (i.e. this feature is a specialized version of XPFO[1], which
tried to do this for ALL user memory.) So in that regard, yes, this has
value in the sense that to perform exfiltration, an attacker would need
a significant level of control over kernel execution or over page table
contents.

Sufficient control over PTE allocation and positioning is possible
without kernel execution control[3], and "only" having an arbitrary
write primitive can lead to direct PTE control. Because of this, it
would be nice to have page tables strongly protected[2] in the kernel.
They remain a viable "data only" attack given a sufficiently "capable"
write flaw.

I would argue that page table entries are a more important asset to
protect than userspace secrets, but given the difficulties with XPFO
and the not-yet-available PKS I can understand starting here. It does,
absolutely, narrow the ways exploits must be written to exfiltrate secret
contents. (We are starting to now constrict[4] many attack methods
into attacking the page table itself, which is good in the sense that
protecting page tables will be a big win, and bad in the sense that
focusing attack research on page tables means we're going to see some
very powerful attacks.)

I would say "cross-process secret userspace memory exposures" (via a
number of common interfaces by blocking it at the GUP level).

I don't see how this series protects against privilege escalation. (It
protects against exfiltration.) Maybe you mean include this in the first
bullet point (i.e. "cross-process secret userspace memory exposures,
even in the face of privileged processes")?

Same here, I don't see it preventing ROP, but I see it making "simple"
ROP insufficient to perform exfiltration.
