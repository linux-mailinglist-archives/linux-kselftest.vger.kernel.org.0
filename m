Indeed, a Landlocked process must no be able to change its mount
namespace layout. However, bind mounts may already exist.
Let's say a process sandbox itself to only access /a in a read-write
way. Then, this process (or one of its children) add a new restriction
on /a/b to only be able to read this hierarchy. The check at insertion
time would allow this because this access right is a subset of the
access right allowed with the parent directory. However, If /a/b is bind
mounted somewhere else, let's say in /private/b, then the second
enforcement just gave new access rights to this hierarchy too. This is
why it seems risky to rely on a check about the legitimacy of a new
access right when adding it to a ruleset or when enforcing it.
