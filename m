How those two objectives go along? Or maybe our understanding of what
scrace really means here. If the pool of the secret memory is very limited
then you really need a way to stop one party from depriving others. More
on that below.

I hoped I had made my points really clear. The existing scheme allows
one users (potentially adversary) to deplete the preallocated pool
and cause a shitstorm of OOM killer because there is no real way to
replenish the pool from the oom killer other than randomly keep killing
tasks until one happens to release its secret memory back to the
pool. Is that more clear now?

And no, rlimit and memcg limit will not save you from that because the
former is per process and later is hard to manage under a single limit
which might be order of magnitude larger than the secret memory pool
size. See the point?

I have also proposed potential ways out of this. Either the pool is not
fixed sized and you make it a regular unevictable memory (if direct map
fragmentation is not considered a major problem) or you need a careful
access control or you need SIGBUS on the mmap failure (to allow at least
some fallback mode to caller).

I do not see any other way around it. I might be missing some other
ways but so far I keep hearing that the existing scheme is just fine
because this has been discussed in the past and you have agreed it is
ok. Without any specifics...

Please keep in mind this is a user interface and it is due to careful
scrutiny. So rather than pushing back with "you are disrupting a
consensus" kinda feedback, please try to stay technical.

OK, fair enough. This belongs to the changelog IMHO. It is good to know
why existing interfaces do not match the need.
