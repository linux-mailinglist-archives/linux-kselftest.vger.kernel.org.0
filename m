Since the `cpy` condition is updated and passed to each new branch
(IOW: after setting cpy =3D 0 for whatever reason all the further code
is skipped) you can drop the variable and do early returns everywhere.
E.g.:

if ((bitmap & p->required_mask) !=3D p->required_mask)
  return 0;
if (p->anyof_mask && !(bitmap & p->anyof_mask))
  return 0;
if (bitmap & p->excluded_mask)
  return 0;
if (!bitmap)
  return 0;

Also you can take the "special" effect of masking with zero to be
always zero (and in C - false) to avoid testing for an empty mask
separately in most cases.

A low priority / cosmetic item that you might consider ignoring if a
fix is too expensive or controversial.

If cur->len =3D=3D 0, then it doesn't matter if it gets merged or not - it
can be filtered out during the flush (see below).

I've gone through and hopefully understood the code. I'm not sure this
needs to be so complicated: when traversing a single PMD you can
always copy p->cur to p->vec[p->vec_index++] because you can have at
most pages_per_PMD non-merges (in the worst case the last page always
is left in p->cur and whole p->vec is used). After each PMD p->vec
needs a flush if p->vec_index > 0, skipping the dummy entry at front
(len =3D=3D 0; if present). (This is mostly how it is implemented now, but
I propose to remove the "overflow" check and do the starting guard
removal only every PMD.)

BTW, the pagemap_scan_deposit() got me a bit confused: it seems that
it is just a copy of the p->vec flush to userspace. Please either use
it for both p->vec and p->cur flushing or inline.

BTW#2, I think the ENOSPC return in pagemap_scan_output() should
happen later - only if the pages would match and that caused the count
to exceed the limit. For THP n_pages should be truncated to the limit
(and ENOSPC returned right away) only after the pages were verified to
match.

I mean that there are cases like [1] that actually need the #ifdef at
least to wrap HPAGE_SIZE usage. But maybe just this constant can be
wrapped so that we keep the code always compile-tested?

Yes. I'm not sure we need to prevent multiple ways of doing the same
thing. But doesn't pagemap reading lack the range aggregation feature?

On the second look, I think the code already checks that while doing
copy_to_user(), so this check is redundant and can be removed.

From:
+ * struct pm_scan_arg - Pagemap ioctl argument
+ * @size:              Size of the structure
+ * @flags:             Flags for the IOCTL
+ * @start:             Starting address of the region
+ * @len:               Length of the region (All the pages in this
length are included)
...

I'd expect the `start` field to just be a virtual address to start
scanning from. Does it need to be mapped? For CRIU usecase I'd start
with "start =3D 0" to find out all mappings, but 0 is (always) not
mapped. Is this supposed to only work on already discovered page
ranges? Anyway, I'd expect the code should be tolerant of another
thread changing the mappings while this ioctl() is walking the page
tables - is it so? If yes, then this check serves at most as an
optimization used only for an invalid call.

I mean is using the same function for both entry points correct? Don't
the pointers to userspace memory (e.g. arg->vec) need to be mapped for
32-bit process?
