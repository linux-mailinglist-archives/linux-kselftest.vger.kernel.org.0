I don't see why that is necessary. Why would we have to walk the file
path when adding a rule?

Using your terminology:
A domain is a collection of N layers, which are assigned indices 0..N-1.
For each possible access type, a domain has a bitmask containing N
bits that stores which layers control that access type. (Basically a
per-layer version of fs_access_mask.)
To validate an access, you start by ORing together the bitmasks for
the requested access types; that gives you the required_bits mask,
which lists all layers that want to control the access.
Then you set seen_policy_bits=3D0, then do the
check_access_path_continue() loop while keeping track of which layers
you've seen with "seen_policy_bits |=3D access->contributing_policies",
or something like that.
And in the end, you check that seen_policy_bits is a superset of
required_bits - something like `(~seen_policy_bits) & required_bits =3D=3D
0`.

AFAICS to create a new domain from a bunch of layers, you wouldn't
have to do any path walking.

(FWIW, you could do the same optimization with the seen_policy_bits approac=
h.)

I guess the difference between your proposal and mine is that in my
proposal, the following would work, in effect permitting W access to
/foo/bar/baz (and nothing else)?

first ruleset:
  /foo W
second ruleset:
  /foo/bar/baz W
third ruleset:
  /foo/bar W

whereas in your proposal, IIUC it wouldn't be valid for a new ruleset
to whitelist a superset of what was whitelisted in a previous ruleset?
