The secret memory is a scarce resource but it's not a facility that
should only be available to some users.

I'm fairly sure rlimit is the correct way to control this.  The
subtlety in both rlimit and memcg tracking comes from deciding to
account under an existing category rather than having our own new one. 
People don't like new stuff in accounting because it requires
modifications to everything in userspace.  Accounting under and
existing limit keeps userspace the same but leads to endless arguments
about which limit it should be under.  It took us several patch set
iterations to get to a fragile consensus on this which you're now
disrupting for reasons you're not making clear.

In the very first patch set we proposed a mmap flag to do this.  Under
detailed probing it emerged that this suffers from several design
problems: the KVM people want VMM to be able to remove the secret
memory range from the process; there may be situations where sharing is
useful and some people want to be able to seal the operations.  All of
this ended up convincing everyone that a file descriptor based approach
was better than a mmap one.
