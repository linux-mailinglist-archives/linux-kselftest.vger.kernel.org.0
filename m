Sure thing, this is the output of:

  $ gcc -I/linux-stable/tools/include -I/linux-stable/tools/arch/x86/include -DUNWINDER_ORC_ENABLED -I ./scripts -E -fdirectives-only /linux-stable/scripts/sorttable.c

Just to make sure, you have the 6.5-rc1+ headers installed and you are
attempting to build the host tools from an earlier Linux release than
6.5-rc1? I don't see a problem with building these host programs on
mainline/6.5, I see this issue when building them in older stable
releases (my reproduction so far has been on 6.4 but I see it when
building all currently supported long term stable releases) when I have
the 6.5-rc1+ headers installed.

Because this is the mainline version, whereas the stable version is:

#ifndef _UAPI__ASM_GENERIC_BITS_PER_LONG
#define _UAPI__ASM_GENERIC_BITS_PER_LONG

/*
 * There seems to be no way of detecting this automatically from user
 * space, so 64 bit architectures should override this in their
 * bitsperlong.h. In particular, an architecture that supports
 * both 32 and 64 bit user space must not rely on CONFIG_64BIT
 * to decide it, but rather check a compiler provided macro.
 */
#ifndef __BITS_PER_LONG
#define __BITS_PER_LONG 32
#endif

#endif /* _UAPI__ASM_GENERIC_BITS_PER_LONG */

which seems to be where the mismatch is coming from?

May be worth looping in the tools/ folks, since that whole directory is
rather special IMO...
