I think we really have a wording problem here, which is why this part of the document 
and this discussion is confusing.

tagged_addr=1 (system-wide) allows processes to enable the tagged address ABI by 
calling prctl(PR_SET_TAGGED_ADDR_CTRL). It does not alter the state of any running 
process, and does not enable the ABI by default for new processes either. Conversely, 
when tagged_addr=0, that prctl() is always denied.

The current description of the sysctl and prctl does not make that clear. I think 
that it would be much more obvious by reorganising that section as such:
- prctl() first, the current wording is fine.
- sysctl() second, described *only* in terms of the prctl() (denying 
PR_SET_TAGGED_ADDR_CTRL or not), and nothing else, to avoid wording issues.

It's certainly not the only way to do it, but that would be much clearer to me :)
