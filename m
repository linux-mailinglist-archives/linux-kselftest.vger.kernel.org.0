But QEMU and other VMMs are users of shmem and memfd.  The new features certainly
aren't useful for _all_ existing users, but I don't think it's fair to say that
they're not useful for _any_ existing users.

And this isn't intended for just TDX (or SNP, or pKVM).  We're not _that_ far off
from being able to use UPM for "regular" VMs as a way to provide defense-in-depth
without having to take on the overhead of confidential VMs.  At that point,
migration and probably even swap are on the table.

Ya, I highly doubt confidential VMs will ever bother with swap.

But secretmem _could_ be a fit.  If a use case wants to unmap guest private memory
from both userspace and the kernel then KVM should absolutely be able to support
that, but at the same time I don't want to have to update KVM to enable secretmem
(and I definitely don't want KVM poking into the directmap itself).

MFD_INACCESSIBLE should only say "this memory can't be mapped into userspace",
any other properties should be completely separate, e.g. the inability to migrate
pages is effective a restriction from KVM (acting on behalf of TDX/SNP), it's not
a fundamental property of MFD_INACCESSIBLE.
