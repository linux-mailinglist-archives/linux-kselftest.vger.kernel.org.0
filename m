If KUnit is added to the kernel, and a subsystem that I am submitting
code for has chosen to use KUnit instead of kselftest, then yes, I do
*have* to use KUnit if my submission needs to contain a test for the
code unless I want to convince the maintainer that somehow my case
is special and I prefer to use kselftest instead of KUnittest.

kselftest also supports running a subset of tests.  That subset of tests
can also be a large number of small tests.  There is nothing inherent
in KUnit vs kselftest in this regard, as far as I am aware.

The same is true of kselftest.  You can create lightweight tests in
kselftest.

This would be a difference, but mock functions do not exist in KUnit.
The KUnit test will call the real kernel function in the UML kernel.

I think Brendan has indicated a desire to have mock functions in the
future.

Brendan, do I understand that correctly?
