The problem is that the linux/mount.h and sys/mount.h headers may
conflict depending on the libc version used. So if linux/mount.h is
included care needs to be taken that no headers are included that
implicitly pull in sys/mount.h and vica versa. But if that isn't a
problem in this test and it solves the issue we can just include it.
