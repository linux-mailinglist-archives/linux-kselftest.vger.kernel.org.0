Yes, this was exactly the case. We then reworked it a lot (see 
958ef1e39d24 ("livepatch: Simplify API by removing registration step"), so 
now the call sequence is different. kobject_put() is basically offloaded 
to a workqueue scheduled right from the store() method. Meaning that 
Luis's work would probably not help us currently, but on the other hand 
the issues with AA deadlock were one of the main drivers of the redesign 
(if I remember correctly). There were other reasons too as the changelog 
of the commit describes.

So, from my perspective, if there was a way to easily synchronize between 
a data cleanup from module_exit callback and sysfs/kernfs operations, it 
could spare people many headaches.

kobject_del() already calls kobject_put(). Did you mean __kobject_del(). 
That one is internal though.

Does the above makes sense?

Thanks
