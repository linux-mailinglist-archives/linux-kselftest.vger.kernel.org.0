Please note that the masks are not inverted -- the values are. Masks
select which categories you want to filter on, and category_inverted
invert the meaning of a match (match 0 instead of 1).

For ResetWriteWatch() you would:

args.flags = PM_SCAN_WP_MATCHING;
args.categories_mask = PAGE_IS_WPASYNC | PAGE_IS_WRITTEN;
args.return_mask = 0;

Or (if you want to error out if the range doesn't have WP enabled):

args.flags = PM_SCAN_WP_MATCHING | PM_SCAN_CHECK_WPASYNC;
args.categories_mask = PAGE_IS_WRITTEN;
args.return_mask = 0;

(PM_SCAN_CHECK_WPASYNC is effectively adding PAGE_IS_WPASYNC to the
required categories.)

This is for users of WP that want to ignore WP for non-registered ranges
instead of erroring out on them. (I anticipate CRIU to use this.)

For THP indeed - the code should check `end != start + HPAGE_SIZE`
instead of `ret == -ENOSPC`.

For HugeTLB there is a check that returns EINVAL when trying to WP
a partial page. I think I didn't change that part.

Indeed. I did first push the max_pages check in, hence the 'extracting'
later.

This is to avoid having to much indentation and long functions that do
many things at once.

Yes, there are now two pairs instead of one. I see that I haven't pushed
the is_interesting calls into scan_output. This is now trivial:
	if (!interesting...) {
		*end = start;
		return 0;
	}
and could save some typing (but would need a different name for
scan_output as it would do filter & output), but I'm not sure about
readability.
