It is a commonly understood pattern, but I don't think it's what the
code is doing. Try-catch cleans up an entire stack and allows each level
of the stack to apply local cleanup. This implementation simply exits a
thread and has none of that complexity. To me, it seems like an odd
abstraction here as it's really just a test runner that can exit early
(though I haven't seen the follow-up UML implementation).

I would prefer to see this cleaned up such that the abstraction matches
more what's going on but I don't feel that strongly about it so I'll
leave it up to you to figure out what's best unless other reviewers have
stronger opinions.

Adding indirection and function pointers solely for the purpose of
mocking out while testing doesn't sit well with me and I don't think it
should be a pattern that's encouraged. Adding extra complexity like this
to a design to make it unit-testable doesn't seem like something that
makes sense in kernel code. Especially given that indirect calls are
more expensive in the age of spectre.

Also, mocking these particular functions seems like it's an artifact of
how you've designed the try/catch abstraction. If the abstraction was
more around an abort-able test runner then it doesn't make sense to need
to mock out the abort/fail functions as you will be testing overly
generic features of something that don't seem necessary to the
implementation.

Yes, remove them now and add them back when you use them in follow-up
patches. If reviewers find problems with the follow-up patches or have a
better suggestion on how to do what ever it is you are doing, then you
just have this unnecessary code and there's wasted developer time and
review bandwidth that will need to be spent cleaning it up.
