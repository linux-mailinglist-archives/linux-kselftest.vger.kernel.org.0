I haven't argued that performance would be better using sendfile2
compared to iouring, just that existing apps which already use
sendfile (but do so unsafely) would probably be more likely to use a
safe alternative with existing examples of how to harvest completion
notifications vs something more complex, like wrapping iouring.

I don't disagree; I just don't know if app developers:
  a.) know that this is possible to do, and
  b.) know how to do it

In general: it does seem a bit odd to me that there isn't a safe
sendfile syscall in Linux that uses existing completion notification
mechanisms.

Of course, I certainly agree that the error queue is a work around.
But it works, app use it, and its fairly well known. I don't see any
reason, other than historical context, why sendmsg can use this
mechanism, splice can, but sendfile shouldn't?

I'm not opposed to dropping the sendfile2 part of the series for the
official submission. I do think it is a bit odd to add the
functionality to splice only, though, when probably many apps are
using splice via calls to sendfile and there is no way to safely use
sendfile.

If you feel very strongly that this cannot be merged without
dropping sendfile2 and only plumbing this through for splice, then
I'll drop the sendfile2 syscall when I submit officially (probably
next week?).

I do feel pretty strongly that it's more likely apps would use
sendfile2 and we'd have safer apps out in the wild. But, I could be
wrong.

That said: if the new syscsall is the blocker, I'll drop it and
offer a change to the sendfile man page suggesting users swap it
with calls to splice + error queue for safety.

I greatly appreciate you taking a look and your feedback.

Thanks,
Joe
