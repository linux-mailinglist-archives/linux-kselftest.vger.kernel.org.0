In my observation, failing zram_remove() is extremely easy to trigger, which
is caused by reset_store() which sets ->reclaim as true, so
zram_remove() is failed and zram_reset_device() is bypassed , then the
failure of 'Error: Removing state 63 which has instances left.' is caused.

We are in same page?

It is zram's bug. zram has to clean everything in module_exit(),
unfortunately zram_remove() can be failed when calling from
module_exit() because ->claim is set as true by reset_store(), then
zram_reset_device()(->zcomp_destroy) isn't called, and this failure should
not happen when unloading module, should it?

What is the race for CPU multistate support? If you mean 'Error: Removing
state 63 which has instances left.', it is zram's bug since zram has to
cleanup everything in module_exit().

wrt. in-tree zram, there is neither any deadlock in linus tree, nor after
applying my 3 patches. If you think there is, please share us the code
or lockdep warning.

The 'deadlock' is actually caused by your out-of-tree patch of 'zram: fix
crashes with cpu hotplug multistate' which adds mutex_lock(zram_index_mutex)
in destroy_devices().

We can fix this issue easily without needing the global lock, please see the
attached(pre-V2) patch.

In-tree zram doesn't have such deadlock, if livepatching has such AA deadlock,
just fixed it, and seems it has been fixed by 3ec24776bfd0.

In fsl_wakeup_sys_exit(), device_remove_file() is called before
acquiring &sysfs_lock, so there shouldn't be such AA deadlock.

Yeah, there is the AA deadlock risk, but it should be fixed by moving
misc_deregister() out of &test_fw_mutex.

OK, I can keep current behavior: fail open() in case of removing or
resetting, meantime not hold open_mutex when sync bdev and reset device,
see attached patch.

It is because the patch 2 holds ->open_mutex() for sync bdev and reset
zram, so several 'CTRL-C' is needed for terminating the test script, then
zram02.sh's cleanup handler can be interrupted too. We can keep current
behavior easily.

Please try the following patch against upstream(linus or next) tree(basically
fold revised 2 and 3 of V1, and cover two issues: not fail zram_remove in
module_exit(), race between zram_remove() and disksize_store()), and see if
everything is fine for you:
