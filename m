No I really appreciate it, thank you for your input! Having a variable
limit is not necessary. The motivation is to create a UABI that would be
flexible into the future where an application may want more (or less)
bits reserved than what ADDR_LIMIT_48BIT would provide. However,
current applications are happy to work with 48-bit address spaces so
having the 48-bit personality is sufficient.

There will still need to be some management in the userland software to
ensure that the personality has been set before any allocations, but
that is unavoidable with any solution.
