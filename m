The 'for' at the end of the line above is not needed.

This should be GCSCRE0_EL1.

I presume a new lock prctl() won't allow unlocking but can only extend
the lock. I haven't looked at the patches yet but it may be worth
spelling this out.

Sorry if this has been discussed in other threads. What is the issue
with unmapping/freeing of the shadow stack?

What's the rationale here? Is it that function returns won't work?

Is this number based on the fact that a function call would only push
the LR to GCS while standard function prologue pushes at least two
registers?

Does this not contradict an earlier statement that the GCS is not freed
for a thread when disabled?

I lost track of the GCS spec versions. Has the valid cap token format
been updated? What I have in my spec (though most likely old) is:

  An entry in the Guarded control stack is defined as a Valid cap entry,
  if bits [63:12] of the value are same as bits [63:12] of the address
  where the entry is stored and bits [11:0] contain a Valid cap token.


The other bits in the code look fine to me so far but I haven't looked
at the code yet.
