As Brendan says, any such tests probably shouldn't be buildable
as modules, but I wonder if we need to add some sort of way
to ensure execution from debugfs is not allowed for such cases?
Even if a test suite is builtin, it can be executed via debugfs
in the patches I sent out, allowing suites to be re-run.  Sounds
like we need a way to control that behaviour based on the
desired test suite execution environment.

Say, for example, the "struct kunit_suite" definitions associated
with the tests was marked as __initdata; are there any handy macros to 
identify it as being in the __init section? If so, we could simply
avoid adding a "run" file to the debugfs representation for such
suites.  Failing that, perhaps we need some sort of flags field
in "struct kunit_suite" to specify execution environment constraints?

Thanks!

Alan
