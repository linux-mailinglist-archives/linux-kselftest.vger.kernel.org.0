Sorry, unable to understand where to remove the guard?

I can inline this function if you say so, now that you understand all the
logic. I don't see what else can be done here.

We have 2 counters here:
* the p->max_pages optionally can be set to find out only N pages of
interest. So p->found_pages is counting this. We need to return early if
the page limit is complete.
* the p->vec_index keeps track of output buffer array size

Some arch define HPAGE_SIZE even if huge page config isn't enabled and some
don't. Lets just add #ifdef CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE as it is just like
the similar code in this same file is using this same #ifdef.

Yeah, correct. But note that we are supporting only selective 4 flags in
this ioctl, not all pagemap flags. So it is useful for only those users who
depend only on these 4 flags. Out pagemap_ioctl interface is not so much
generic that we can cater anyone. Its interface is specific and we are
adding only those cases which are of our interest. So if someone wants
range aggregation from pagemap_ioctl, he'll need to add that flag in the
IOCTL first. When IOCTL support is added, he can specify the selection
criterion etc.

Ohh... Ignore my previous comment. Yeah, any valid memory range can be
passed to view the page flags. This check just verifies if the memory range
is valid.

No, every member is our argument structure is of 64 bit in our structure
which keeps memory layout same. So we don't need any specific conversion
here. (Even if we had any 32-bit variable, we just needed to make sure that
the layout remains the same in the memory.)
