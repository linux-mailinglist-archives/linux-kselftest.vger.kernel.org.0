I do not open a dirfd, look at the benchmark code in the patch, it's all
right there.

I can make it simpler, will do that for the next round as I want to make
it really obvious for people to test on their hardware.

No need to open dirfd at all, my benchmarks did not do that, just pass
in an absolute path if you don't want to.  But if you want to, because
you want to read a bunch of files, you can, faster than you could if you
wanted to read a number of individual files without it :)
