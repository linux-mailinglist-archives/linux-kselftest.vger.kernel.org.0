Yes, I agree, having public result storage would be awesome. I think KCIDB is 
relatively-well positioned to take on some of that work. We have the POC 
dashboard already. Well, *had* until somebody scraped it and exhausted our 
cloud budget, I'm working on making it cheaper before bringing it back.

Meanwhile you can get a glimpse of it in one of my slide decks:
https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/eoss2023/ef/Kernel%20CI%20%E2%80%93%20How%20Far%20Can%20It%20Go%20%E2%80%93%20EOSS%202023.pdf

We also have an artifact-mirroring system (quite basic at the moment), 
expecting the submitter to already have the files hosted somewhere. We would 
need to add a file upload service to that.

Finally, I'm considering opening up submissions to (Google-authenticated) 
public, as opposed to just CI systems, so we could support this. That's still 
more work though.

Regarding analysis, I have plenty of ideas for that too, and even more ideas 
are explored by others lately. I just need to bring back the dashboard and 
find the time for all of it :D

Anyone interested in helping with any of this?

Nick
