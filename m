Sorry, I wrote it wrongly. (All the masks are not optional.) Let me
rephrase. All or at least any 1 of the 3 masks (required, any, exclude)
must be specified. The return_mask must always be specified. Error is
returned if all 3 masks (required, anyof, exclude) are zero or return_mask
is zero.

There is no ordering in current masks scheme. No mask is preferable. For a
page to get selected, all the definitions of the masks must be fulfilled.
You have come up with good example that what if required_mask =
exclude_mask. In this case, no page will fulfill the criterion and hence no
page would be selected. It is user's fault that he isn't understanding the
definitions of these masks correctly.

Now thinking about it, I can add a error check which would return error if
a bit in required and excluded masks matches. Would you like it? Lets put
this check in place.
(Previously I'd left it for user's wisdom not to do this. If he'll specify
same masks in them, he'll get no addresses out of the syscall.)
