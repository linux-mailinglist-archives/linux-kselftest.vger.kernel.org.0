Hi Luis,

I'm glad you are a subject expert in this area.

Some more comments inline.

Great (kill it!).  I have no need for cached or batched requests.

The would remove a lot of problems.

I would only volunteer to remove it, not test or support it.

Again, I would only volunteer to remove the fallback mechanism to remove 
added race conditions.

I think it's a minor issue compared to the race conditions present.

In reality I don't think anyone will load the same firmware using cache vs.

no-cache.

It's just something I stumbled upon when adding the test case and then 
had to avoid.

I don't know if it's the same bug for the "no uevent" test case though?  
The test

just hangs and the kernel oops is not present.  It might be exposing another

underlying issue with the request_firmware code.

I'm working on cleaning up the driver right now to upstream.

First thing is I need the request_firmware_into_buf tests accepted upstream.

Then I can add my enhancement to request_firmware_into_buf to partial 
read the file (previous sent out but needed test case).

In order to do so Greg K-H required a test case for this but even the 
current API had no test.

In that patch series I can then add the new driver which requires my 
enhanced request_firmware_into_buf.

Is there a way to not use the batch firmware request mechanism when 
calling request_firmware_into_buf

to see if the problem doesn't happen?

I don't have another solution with all the other mechanisms in

play in the current firmware code.  For now I'll leave the mutex

in the driver I'm upstreaming so it works reliably.

OK, I don't use any of the other mechanisms right now.

All I require is request_firmware_into_buf.
