I do not have Android (bionic/libc) as part of my testing environment hence I
never saw this issue. Thanks for reporting it.

I am investigating the problem and will post a fix as soon as it is ready.

As Will suggested, .config would help the debugging and I would like to ask to
you to test my fix once it is ready. Is that OK for you?
