Totally understandable, I was really confused at first too.

Right. I will note sorttable is not the only utility that has this
issue, I see the same problem coming from several files in
tools/lib/subcmd when building several different architectures and
arch/x86/entry/vdso/vdso2c.c at the very least.

That seems like a reasonable theory. I am still busy looking into other
things today but I can try to double back to this on Monday if you don't
make any progress.
