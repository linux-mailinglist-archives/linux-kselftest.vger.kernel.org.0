Alright, I will adjust this.

437 sounds good to me.

I considered doing this (and even had a preliminary version of it), but
I discovered that I was not in favour of this idea -- once I started to
write tests using it -- for a few reasons:

  1. It doesn't really allow for clean extension for a future 6th
	 argument (because you are using up O_* flags to signify "use the
	 next argument", and O_* flags don't give -EINVAL if they're
	 unknown). Now, yes you can do the on-start runtime check that
	 everyone does -- but I've never really liked having to do it.

	 Having reserved padding for later extensions (that is actually
	 checked and gives -EINVAL) matches more modern syscall designs.

  2. I really was hoping that the variadic openat(2) could be done away
     using this union setup (Linus said he didn't like it, and suggested
	 using something like 'struct stat' as an argument for openat(2) --
	 though personally I am not sure I would personally like to use an
	 interface like that).

  3. In order to avoid wasting a syscall argument for mode/mask you need
	 to either have something like your suggested mode_mask (which makes
	 the syscall arguments less consistent) or have some sort of
	 mode-like argument that is treated specially (which is really awful
	 on multiple levels -- this one I also tried and even wrote my
	 original tests using). And in both cases, the shims for
	 open{,at}(2) are somewhat less clean.

All of that being said, I'd be happy to switch to whatever you think
makes the most sense. As long as it's possible to get an O_PATH with
RESOLVE_IN_ROOT set, I'm happy.

Thanks, I will fix this.
