Thanks for this, I saw Szabolcs comments.

Ok.

Agree.

I will move the last two (rewording them) to the _section_ 2, but I would still
prefer the Introduction to give an overview of the solution as well.

Good point I missed this.

What this means is that on syscall return the tags are preserved, but if for
example you have tagged pointers inside siginfo_t, they will not because
according to tagged-pointers.txt non-zero tags are not preserved when delivering
signals.
