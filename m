The only other option is to implement another page_pool for ppiov and
have the driver create page_pool or ppiov_pool depending on the state
of the netdev_rx_queue (or some helper in the net stack to do that for
the driver). This introduces some code duplication. The ppiov_pool &
page_pool would look similar in implementation.

But this was all discussed in detail in RFC v2 and the last response I
heard from Jesper was in favor if this approach, if I understand
correctly:

https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/7aedc5d5-0daf-63be-21bc-3b724cc1cab9@redhat.=
com/

Would love to have the maintainer weigh in here.

I don't see the issue. The static branch sets the non-ppiov path as
default if no memory providers are in use, and flips it when they are,
making the default branch prediction ideal in both cases.

The way I'm imagining the support, I don't see the need for such
flags. We'd be re-using generic helpers like
page_pool_iov_get_dma_address() and what not that don't need that
checking.

The page_pool_page* & page_pool_iov* functions can be renamed if
confusing. I would think that's no issue (note that the page_pool_*
functions need not be called for TX path).
