Hi Peter,

Thank you for your reply.

The only difference can be that UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT acquires read mm lock
once for entire duration. But for PAGEMAP_SCAN IOCTL, we acquire and
release for each PMD to keep intermediate buffer short.

This must be hard to convince you. So I'll write some test to see what is
the exact difference and show you the numbers.
