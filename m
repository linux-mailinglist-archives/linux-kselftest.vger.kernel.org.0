Do you have a link to those earlier patches?

The crux of my complaint is that the string stream API is too loosely
defined to be usable. It allows tests to build up a string of
unstructured information, but with certain calling constraints so we
have to tread carefully. If there was more structure to the data that's
being recorded then the test case runner could operate on the data
without having to do string/stream operations, allocations, etc. This
would make the assertion logic much more concrete and specific to kunit,
instead of this small kunit wrapper that's been placed on top of string
stream.

TL;DR: If we can get rid of the string stream API I'd view that as an
improvement because building arbitrary strings in the kernel is complex,
error prone and has calling context concerns.

Is the intention that other code besides unit tests will use this string
stream API to build up strings? Any targets in mind? This would be a
good way to get the API merged upstream given that its 2019 and we
haven't had such an API in the kernel so far.

An "object oriented" (strong quotes!) approach where kunit_fail_msg is
the innermost struct in some assertion specific structure might work
nicely and allow the test runner to call a generic 'format' function to
print out the message based on the type of assertion/expectation it is.
It probably would mean less code size too because the strings that are
common will be in the common printing function instead of created twice,
in the macros/code and then copied to the heap for the string stream.

	struct kunit_assert {
		const char *line;
		const char *file;
		const char *func;
		void (*format)(struct kunit_assert *assert);
	};

	struct kunit_comparison_assert {
		enum operator operator;
		const char *left;
		const char *right;
		struct kunit_assert assert;
	};

	struct kunit_bool_assert {
		const char *truth;
		const char *statement;
		struct kunit_assert assert;
	};

	void kunit_format_comparison(struct kunit_assert *assert)
	{
		struct kunit_comparison_assert *comp =3D container_of(assert, ...)

		kunit_printk(...)
	}

Maybe other people have opinions here on if you should do it now or
later. Future coding is not a great argument because it's hard to
predict the future. On the other hand, this patchset is in good shape to
merge and I'd like to use it to write unit tests for code I maintain so
I don't want to see this stall out. Sorry if I'm opening the can of
worms you're talking about.
