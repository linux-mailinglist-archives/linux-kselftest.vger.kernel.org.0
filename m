That's an interesting point I didn't realize so far.

I was wondering if this also helps against CPU microcode issues like 
spectre and friends.

What stops "root" from mapping /dev/mem and reading that memory?

IOW, would we want to enforce "CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM" with CONFIG_SECRETMEM?


Also, there is a way to still read that memory when root by

1. Having kdump active (which would often be the case, but maybe not to 
dump user pages )
2. Triggering a kernel crash (easy via proc as root)
3. Waiting for the reboot after kump() created the dump and then reading 
the content from disk.

Or, as an attacker, load a custom kexec() kernel and read memory from 
the new environment. Of course, the latter two are advanced mechanisms, 
but they are possible when root. We might be able to mitigate, for 
example, by zeroing out secretmem pages before booting into the kexec 
kernel, if we care :)
