I meant the newly forked child exiting, not nolibc-test in general.
The exit is just below, so the fds in the child are close here anyways.

This would still access uninitialized memory and lead to UB in strcmp as
not all bytes in buf were written to by read().

If we want to be really sure we should use memcmp() instead of strcmp().
For memcmp() I would prefer to transfer and check without the '\0', so
my review comments from before need to be adapted a bit.
