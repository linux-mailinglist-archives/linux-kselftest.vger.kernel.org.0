The intention is that *everything* becomes conditional, based on both
the host CPU support and the feature set advertised to the guest.
Which means that we don't stuff that isn't advertised to the guest,
and instead make these things UNDEF. Just like on any real CPU
implementation.

That doesn't explain why you can't be upfront with it and populate the
FPMR entry. In either case, you are wasting a u64.

Either that, or you create a KVM-specific structure that contains
these fields. If that results in KVM changes, so be it. But I won't
take this sort of pointer arithmetic that assumes some pre-defined
layout.

See my earlier point: you shouldn't have to check if you used a data
structure.

See the beginning of this email. It is high time that we stop enabling
everything by default, because this totally breaks VM migration. We
already have a huge backlog of these things, and I don't want to add
more of it.

Which means that at the very least, enabling *any* feature also comes
with sanitising the state one way or another when this feature is
disabled by userspace.

How this is being done is still a work in progress: my current plan is
based on a set of trap bits that are computed on a per-VM basis, and
some side state that indicates whether the trap handling is for
emulation or feature disabling purpose. This will probably reuse the
NV infrastructure which has an exhaustive list of the sysregs that can
be trapped from EL0/EL1.

At the very least, userspace shouldn't be able to observe the state
that a guest isn't supposed to generate, and we should be mindful of
not creating covert channels.
