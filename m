No need to be sorry. :)

Ah, so actually I find this argument much more compelling.

I don't find it persuasive that we should put it in /proc for the
purpose of supporting cross-process memory manipulation, because I
think the syscall works better for that, and in that case we don't
mind depending on CAP_SYS_PTRACE.

But, what you've argued here I do find persuasive. :) You are right, I
can't think of any other example of a device node in /dev that works
like this, where it is completely independent on a per-process basis.
The closest I could come up with was /dev/zero or /dev/null or
similar. You won't affect any other process by touching these, but I
don't think these are good examples.

I'll send a v5 which does this. I do worry that cross-process support
is probably complex to get right, so I might leave that out and only
allow a process to open its own device for now.
