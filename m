[fixing Drew's email, again]

Oh, I totally agree that a standalone use of kvm_clear_request() must
come with a barrier. It is just that without additional data, it isn't
obvious to me that there is any need for kvm_clear_request() itself to
have the barrier.

In a number of cases, kvm_clear_request() is used on in the context of
the same vcpu, and this should be enough to ensure visibility (for
example, I don't think kvm_vcpu_wfi() should require this barrier).

But maybe I'm missing something.

Thanks,

	M.
