Question is that why one shared lock is required between kobject_del()
and its show()/store(), both zram and livepatch needn't that. Is it
one common usage?

Actually kernfs/sysfs provides interface for supporting deleting
kobject/attr from the attr's show()/store(), see example of
sdev_store_delete(), and the livepatch example:

If kobject_del() is done in module_exit() or before module_exit(),
kobject should have been freed in module_exit() via kobject_put().

But yes, it can be asynchronously because of CONFIG_DEBUG_KOBJECT_RELEASE,
seems like one real issue.
