I agree with you (mostly :), but except one thing: you passed in SGP_READ, so
IMHO it won't do what you explained (see [1] above: "goto clear" is with "sgp
!= SGP_READ" only); instead of doing what you said, I think it'll reset page
pointer to NULL..  Then quickly in the latter block:

	if (page || sgp == SGP_READ)
		goto out;

So I think at last shmem_getpage_gfp(SGP_READ) will return NULL.

I do think I've got some confusion here regarding SGP_READ, since from the
comment in shmem_fs.h it says:

	SGP_READ,	/* don't exceed i_size, don't allocate page */

It's natural to think it as "return the fallocated page" in this case.  However
it seems not the case?  My gut feeling is the comment for SGP_READ needs a
touch up, so as to state that for newly fallocated (and not used) pages it'll
return NULL even if cache hit.

So I think you're right, for all cases this may be a trivial case.  However
I've got a lesson somewhere else that we should never overlook zero pages,
which is also related to this case - although fallocated page is still
!Uptodate so clear page happens even latter, however from userspace pov, the
user could assume it's a zero page even if the page is not accessed at all
(since any access will cause clear page).  Then the user program could avoid
modifying this page if it knows this page keeps to be zero page somehow (e.g.,
a zero page bitmap?). Then your example above [2] seems indeed a valid one
worth thinking, at least not fully paranoid.
