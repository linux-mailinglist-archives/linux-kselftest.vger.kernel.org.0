No, and no.

I think this type of thing is, sadly, folly.  You are entering into a
path that never ends with no clear goal that you are conveying here to
us.

I might be totally wrong, but I fail to see what you want to have happen
in the end.

Every in-kernel api documented in a "formal" way like this?  Or a
subset?  If a subset, which ones specifically?  How many?  And who is
going to do that?  And who is going to maintain it?  And most
importantly, why is it needed at all?

For some reason Linux has succeeded in pretty much every place an
operating system is needed for cpus that it can run on (zephyr for those
others that it can not.)  So why are we suddenly now, after many
decades, requiring basic user/kernel stuff to be formally documented
like this?

In the past, when we have had "validating bodies" ask for stuff like
this, the solution is to provide it in a big thick book, outside of the
kernel, by the company that wishes to sell such a product to that
organization to justify the cost of doing that labor.  In every instance
that I know of, that book sits on a shelf and gathers dust, while Linux
is just updated over the years in those sites to new versions and the
book goes quickly out of date as no one really cares about it, except
it having been a check-box for a purchase order requirement.

That's business craziness, no need to get us involved in all of that.
Heck, look at the stuff around FIPS certification for more insanity.
That's a check-box that is required by organizations and then totally
ignored and never actually run at all by the user.  I feel this is much
the same.

So step back, and tell us exactly what files and functions and apis are
needed to be documented in this stilted and formal way, who exactly is
going to be doing all of that work, and why we should even consider
reviewing and accepting and most importantly, maintaining such a thing
for the next 40+ years.

I made many comments on patch 3, the most important one being that the
tests created do not seem to follow any of the standards we have for
Linux kernel tests for no documented reason.

The irony of submitting tests for formal specifications that do not
follow documented policies is rich :)
