The test could be simpler if it does not need to run in two separate machines.

Also, there are bpf_prog_test_run_opts() style tests that provide a device 
agnostic way to test the xdp helpers/features which should have covered most of 
the cases exercised in progs/xdp_features.c?

I am not sure which case in xdp_features.c does not have existing coverage in 
test_progs. From a quick look, it seems only BPF_MAP_TYPE_CPUMAP is missing 
(please check)? If that is the case, it may be more straight forward to add this 
one test case to the test_progs. Check if it can borrow a similar setup from 
prog_tests/test_xdp_veth.c, and then leave xdp_features.* as-is.

There are other .sh tests that could better use the test_progs migration. In 
particular the ones without existing test coverage. For non XDP related, 
test_tcp_check_syncookie.sh, test_flow_dissector.sh, and test_tc_edt.sh should 
be the good ones.

For XDP, test_xdp_meta.sh should be useful also. You may also want to check the 
test_xdp_redirect_*.sh.
