For more context: we had been seeing occasional glitches with this test 
in our continuous kernel integration suite.  In every case, it seemed 
that the worker thread wasn't running when expected, so I assumed that 
system load had something to do with it.  We shuffled the ordering of 
tests, but still encountered issues and I decided life was too sort to 
continue remotely debugging sleep-"synchronized" code.

Yannick's patches look fine to me, so for those:

Acked-by: Joe Lawrence <joe.lawrence@redhat.com>

(I can ack individually if required, let me know.)
