I took a deeper look here, and with some effort I'm able to remove
almost all the custom checks for ppiov. The only remaining checks for
devmem are the checks around these mm calls:

page_is_pfmemalloc()
page_to_nid()
page_ref_count()
compound_head()

page_is_pfmemalloc() checks can be removed by using a bit
page->pp_magic potentially to indicate pfmemalloc().

The other 3, I'm not sure I can remove. They rely on the page flags or
other fields not specific to page_pool pages. The next version should
come with the most minimal amount of devmem checks for the page_pool.
