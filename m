I'm back to reply to this subthread, after a delay, as promised.

kselftest in-kernel tests provide exactly the same when the tests are
configured as "built-in" code instead of as modules.

The first item exists in kselftest.

I might be wrong here because I have not dug deeply enough into the
code!!!  Does this framework apply to the userspace tests, the
in-kernel tests, or both?  My "not having dug enough GUESS" is that
these are for the user space tests (although if so, they could be
extended for in-kernel use also).

So I think this one maybe does not have an overlap between KUnit
and kselftest.

Yes, this I agree with.
