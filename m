No, it's not a bug and these are not the VM_SOFTDIRTY semantics -- just 
because you think they should be like this. As people explained, 
VM_SOFTDIRTY implies *until now* that any PTE is consideres softdirty. 
And there are other scenarios that can similarly trigger something like 
that, besides mprotect().

Sorry if I sound annoyed, but please

1) factor out that from your patch set for now
2) find a way to handle this cleanly, for example, not merging VMAs that
    differ in VM_SOFTDIRTY
