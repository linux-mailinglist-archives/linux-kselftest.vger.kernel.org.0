Interesting. Landlock's goal is to restrict a set of processes, which
can be a container.

Because Landlock deals with unprivileged sandboxing, we must manage
multiple layers. The current implementation in Landlock, according to
the unprivileged constraints, is explained here:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/e07fe473-1801-01cc-12ae-b3167f95250e@digikod.net/

As briefly explained in this patch [1] [2], in the case of Landlock,
being able to change the filesystem layout/topology may lead to
privilege escalation. Currently, Landlock forbids inode reparenting, but
I plan to implement a multilayer partial ordering mechanism to relax
this constraint while still enforcing all layered policies. A short-term
approach could also relaxes the first layer, but we need to think
carefully about the potential implications (including ABI compatibility).

I think Landlock could help in your use case, but could you clarify your
thread model please?

The main issue right now with Landlock is to deal with overlayfs.
Indeed, Landlock's check_access_path() does not work with
orphaned/private mounts like overlayfs layers (cf. ovl_path_real() and
ovl_path_open()). Do you have an idea how to solve this properly? Could
we add a "virtual" mount point to these layers to identify dentries they
are anchored to?

Why not just compare struct path->mnt using the current hooks?

About performances, I also thought that walking through every path
directories would be an important issue, but after some quick benchmark
(with and for Landlock) I'm not sure anymore. A caching mechanism may be
useful but it should not be needed from the start.

I would like to be in Cc in your next "fanotify and LSM path hooks"
emails. Thanks.
