Is this really true? I guess you meant to say that the memory will
visible only via page tables to anybody who can mmap the respective file
descriptor. There is nothing like an owning mm as the fd is inherently a
shareable resource and the ownership becomes a very vague and hard to
define term.

I do not understand how it helps to remove the memory from the process
as the interface explicitly allows to add a memory that is removed from
all other processes via direct map.

It would be great to expand on this some more.

What is this supposed to mean? What are differences?

OK, this looks like a reasonable compromise for the initial
implementation. Documentation of the command line parameter should be
very explicit about this though.

What about munlock?

Please also list usecases which you are aware of as well.

I am also missing some more information about the implementation. E.g.
does this memory live on an unevictable LRU and therefore participates
into stats. What about memcg accounting. What is the cross fork (CoW)/exec
behavior. How is the memory reflected in OOM situation? Is a shared
mapping enforced?

Anyway, thanks for improving the changelog. This is definitely much more
informative.

I have only glanced through the implementation and it looks sane. I will
have a closer look later but this should be pretty simple with the
proposed semantic.
