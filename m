kobject_put() to be precise.

When I started working on the support for module/live patches removal, 
calling kobject_put() under our klp_mutex lock was the obvious first 
choice given how the code was structured, but I ran into problems with 
deadlocks immediately. So it was changed to async approach with the 
workqueue. Thus the mainline code has never suffered from this, but we 
knew about the issues.

From my perspective, it is quite easy to get it wrong due to either a lack 
of generic support, or missing rules/documentation. So if this thread 
leads to "do not share locks between a module removal and a sysfs 
operation" strict rule, it would be at least something. In the same 
manner as Luis proposed to document try_module_get() expectations.

It makes sense to me.

Thanks, Luis, for pursuing it.
