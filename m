We can deadlock in random fun places if random stuff we're calling
suddenly starts allocating. Sometimes. Maybe once in a blue moon, to
make it extra fun to reproduce. Maybe most driver subsystems are less
brittle, but gpu drivers definitely need to know about the details for
exactly this example. And yes gpu drivers use rcu for freeing
dma_fence structures, and that tends to happen in code that we only
recently figured out should really not allocate memory.

I think minimally you need to throw in an unconditional
fs_reclaim_acquire();fs_reclaim_release(); so that everyone who runs
with full debugging knows what might happen. It's kinda like
might_sleep, but a lot more specific. might_sleep() alone is not
enough, because in the specific code paths I'm thinking of (and
created special lockdep annotations for just recently) sleeping is
allowed, but any memory allocations with GFP_RECLAIM set are no-go.

Cheers, Daniel
