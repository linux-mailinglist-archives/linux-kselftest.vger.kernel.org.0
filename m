The problem is that once global resetting is allowed, it makes the
number reported in memory.peak unreliable for everyone. You just don't
know, and can't tell, if somebody wrote to it recently. It's not too
much of a leap to say this breaks the existing interface contract.

You have to decide whether the above is worth implementing. But my
take is that the downsides of the simpler solution outweigh its
benefits.
