I think this interface doesn't have to be limited by the soft-dirty
bits only. For example, CRIU needs to know whether file, present and swap bits
are set or not.

I mean we should be able to specify for what pages we need to get info
for. An ioctl argument can have these four fields:
* required bits (rmask & mask == mask) - all bits from this mask have to be set.
* any of these bits (amask & mask != 0) - any of these bits is set.
* exclude masks (emask & mask == 0) = none of these bits are set.
* return mask - bits that have to be reported to user.

We can conside to return regions that contains pages with the same set
of bits.

struct page_region {
	void *start;
	long size;
	u64 bitmap;
}

And ioctl returns arrays of page_region-s. I believe it will be more
compact form for many cases.
