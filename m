Grr, I always get confused by the code. kobject_del() actually waits
until the sysfs interface gets destroyed. This is why there is
the deadlock.

But kobject_put() is _not_ synchronous. And the comment above
kobject_add() repeat 3 times that kobject_put() must be called
on success:

 * Return: If this function returns an error, kobject_put() must be
 *         called to properly clean up the memory associated with the
 *         object.  Under no instance should the kobject that is passed
 *         to this function be directly freed with a call to kfree(),
 *         that can leak memory.
 *
 *         If this function returns success, kobject_put() must also be called
 *         in order to properly clean up the memory associated with the object.
 *
 *         In short, once this function is called, kobject_put() MUST be called
 *         when the use of the object is finished in order to properly free
 *         everything.

and similar text in Documentation/core-api/kobject.rst

  After a kobject has been registered with the kobject core successfully, it
  must be cleaned up when the code is finished with it.  To do that, call
  kobject_put().


If I read the code correctly then kobject_put() calls kref_put()
that might call kobject_delayed_cleanup(). This function does a lot
of things and need to access struct kobject.

If kobject_put() has to be called also for static structures then
module_exit() must explicitly wait until the clean up is finished.
