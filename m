This is the first patchset:

https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1788057.html

In particular you can see the code for matching functions here:

https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1788073.html

And parameter matching code here:

https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1788072.html

https://www.mail-archive.com/linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org/msg1788086.html

My apologies in advance, but the code at this early stage had not
adopted the kunit_* prefix and was still using the test_* and mock_*
prefix. (Hence, struct kunit_stream was known as struct test_stream).

Yeah, I can see the point of wanting something that provides more
structure than the raw `struct kunit_stream` interface. In fact, it is
something I had already started working on, when I had determined it
would be a large effort to capture all the variations. I was further
put off from the idea when I had been asked to convert the KUnit
intermediate format from what I was using to TAP, because, as it is,
the current data printed out by KUnit doesn't contain all the data I
would like to put in it in a way that best takes advantage of the TAP
specification. One problematic area in particular: TAP already
provides a way to present a lot of the data I would like to export,
but it involves JSON serialization which was an idea that some of the
other reviewers understandably weren't too keen on. TAP also wants to
report data some time after it is available, which is generally not a
good idea for test debug information; you want to make it available as
soon as you can or you risk crashing with the data still inside.

Hence, I decided we could probably spend a good long while debating
how I present the information. So the idea of having a loose
definition seemed attractive to me in its own right since it would
likely conform to whatever we ended up deciding in the long run. Also,
all the better that it was what I already had and no one seemed to
mind too much.

The only constant I expect is that `struct kunit` will likely need to
take an abstract object with a `commit` method, or a `format` method
or whatever so it could control when data was going to be printed out
to the user. We will probably also use a string builder in there
somewhere.

True. No argument there.

Someone, (was it you?) asked about code sharing with a string builder
thingy that was used for creating structured human readable files, but
that seemed like a pretty massive undertaking.

Aside from that, no. I would kind of prefered that nobody used it for
anything else because I the issues you described.

Nevertheless, I think the debate over the usefulness of the
string_stream and kunit_stream are separate topics. Even if we made
kunit_stream more structured, I am pretty sure I would want to use
string_stream or some variation for constructing the message.

I started working on something similarish, but by the time I ended up
coming up with a parent object whose definition was loose enough to
satisfy all the properties required by the child classes it ended up
basically being the same as what I have now just with a more complex
hierarchy of message manipulation logic.

On the other hand, I didn't have the idea of doing the parent object
quite the way you did and that would clean up a lot of the duplicated
first line logic.

I would like to give it a try, but I am afraid I am going to get
sucked down a really deep rabbit hole.

Yeah, that's kind of why I am afraid to go down this road when I have
something that works now and I know works with the mocking stuff I
want to do.

I would like to try your suggestion, but I want to try to make it work
with my mocking patches before I commit to it because otherwise I am
just going to have to back it out in a follow up patchset.

Don't be sorry. I agree with you that the kunit_stream stuff is not very pretty.

Shuah, have we missed the merge window for 5.3?

I saw you only sent one PR out so far for this release, and there
wasn't much in it; I imagine you are going to send at least one more?

I figure, if we still got time to try out your suggestion, Stephen, no
harm in trying.

Also if we missed it, then I have another couple months to play around with it.

What do you think?
