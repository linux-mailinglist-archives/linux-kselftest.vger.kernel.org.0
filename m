OK here's what it's like now, let me know if you'd prefer any change:

  commit 8c2e51e174ed0f998b6bd90244324a4966a55efc
  Author: Thomas Weiﬂschuh <linux@weissschuh.net>
  Date:   Sat Jun 24 12:30:46 2023 +0200

    selftests/nolibc: drop test chmod_net
    
    The test relies on /proc/$PID/net to allow chmod() operations.
    It is the only file or directory in /proc/$PID/ to allow this and a bug.
    That bug will be fixed in the next patch in the series and therefore
    the test would start failing.

Not needed, thank you.
