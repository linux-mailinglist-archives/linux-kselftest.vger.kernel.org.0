I looked at should_dump_page in the CRIU code:
https://github.com/checkpoint-restore/criu/blob/45641ab26d7bb78706a6215fdef8f9133abf8d10/criu/mem.c#L102

When CRIU dumps file private mappings, it needs to get pages that have
PME_PRESENT or PME_SWAP but don't have PME_FILE.

I added Danylo to CC. I think he has a good use-case for the new
interface. Danylo, could you describe it here.
