Sorry for the late reply. I am still catching up from being on vacation.

Cool, I thought you would find this interesting.

The linker table work does sound interesting. Do you have a link?

I was thinking about dynamic dispatching, actually. I thought it would
be handy to be able to build all tests into a single kernel and then
run different tests on different invocations.

Also, for post boot dynamic dispatching, you should check out Alan's
debugfs patches:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-kselftest/CAFd5g46657gZ36PaP8Pi999hPPgBU2Kz94nrMspS-AzGwdBF+g@mail.gmail.com/T/#m210cadbeee267e5c5a9253d83b7b7ca723d1f871

They look pretty handy!

Yep.

Not sure. I still haven't seen any cases where this is necessary, so I
am not super worried about it. Regardless, I don't think this patchset
really changes anything in that regard, we are moving from late_init
to after late_init, so it isn't that big of a change for most use
cases.

Please share if you can think of some things that need to be tested in
early init.

Truth. It seems as though Alan has already fixed this for me, however.
