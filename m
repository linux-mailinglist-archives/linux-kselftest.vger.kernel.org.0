SME, the Scalable Matrix Extension, is an arm64 extension which adds
support for matrix operations, with core concepts patterned after SVE.

SVE introduced some complication in the ABI since it adds new vector
floating point registers with runtime configurable size, the size being
controlled by a prameter called the vector length (VL). To provide control
of this to VMMs we offer two phase configuration of SVE, SVE must first be
enabled for the vCPU with KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT(KVM_ARM_VCPU_SVE), after which
vector length may then be configured but the configurably sized floating
point registers are inaccessible until finalized with a call to
KVM_ARM_VCPU_FINALIZE(KVM_ARM_VCPU_SVE) after which the configurably sized
registers can be accessed.

SME introduces an additional independent configurable vector length
which as well as controlling the size of the new ZA register also
provides an alternative view of the configurably sized SVE registers
(known as streaming mode) with the guest able to switch between the two
modes as it pleases.  There is also a fixed sized register ZT0
introduced in SME2. As well as streaming mode the guest may enable and
disable ZA and (where SME2 is available) ZT0 dynamically independently
of streaming mode. These modes are controlled via the system register
SVCR.

We handle the configuration of the vector length for SME in a similar
manner to SVE, requiring initialization and finalization of the feature
with a pseudo register controlling the available SME vector lengths as for
SVE. Further, if the guest has both SVE and SME then finalizing one
prevents further configuration of the vector length for the other.

Where both SVE and SME are configured for the guest we always present
the SVE registers to userspace as having the larger of the configured
maximum SVE and SME vector lengths, discarding extra data at load time
and zero padding on read as required if the active vector length is
lower. Note that this means that enabling or disabling streaming mode
while the guest is stopped will not zero Zn or Pn as it will when the
guest is running, but it does allow SVCR, Zn and Pn to be read and
written in any order.

Userspace access to ZA and (if configured) ZT0 is always available, they
will be zeroed when the guest runs if disabled in SVCR and the value
read will be zero if the guest stops with them disabled. This mirrors
the behaviour of the architecture, enabling access causes ZA and ZT0 to
be zeroed, while allowing access to SVCR, ZA and ZT0 to be performed in
any order.

If SME is enabled for a guest without SVE then the FPSIMD Vn registers
must be accessed via the low 128 bits of the SVE Zn registers as is the
case when SVE is enabled. This is not ideal but allows access to SVCR and
the registers in any order without duplication or ambiguity about which
values should take effect. This may be an issue for VMMs that are
unaware of SME on systems that implement it without SVE if they let SME
be enabled, the lack of access to Vn may surprise them, but it seems
like an unusual implementation choice.

For SME unware VMMs on systems with both SVE and SME support the SVE
registers may be larger than expected, this should be less disruptive
than on a system without SVE as they will simply ignore the high bits of
the registers.
