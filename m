No, the compiler will never forget those semantics.  But if you tell it
your function named memset() is not the actual standard memset -- via
-fno-builtin-memset for example -- the compiler won't optimise things
involving it quite as much.  You told it so eh?

You can also tell it not to have a __builtin_memset function, but in
this particular case that won;t quite work, since the compiler does need
to have that builtin available to do struct and array initialisations
and the like.

clang says it is a 100% plug-in replacement for GCC, so they will have
to accept all GCC flags.  And in many cases they do.  Cases where they
don't are bugs.

Why do mem* not work in VDSOs?  Fix that, and all these problems
disappear, and you do not need workrarounds :-)
