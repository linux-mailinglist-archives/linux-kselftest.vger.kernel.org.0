Ideally for riscv only writes would cause conversion, an incssp underflow
which performs shadow stack reads would be able to fault early.

For arm, since a syscall is needed anyway to set up the token in a new
shadow stack region, it would make sense for conversion from non-shadow
to shadow usage to never be automatic.

It's certainly undesirable, so I'd like to have both mechanisms available
(shadow stacks in ordinary memory to support several problematic APIs,
and in dedicated mappings with guard pages otherwise).

I'm not quite understanding what the property you're looking for here is.

Naturally.  If an application uses nonportable functionality like JIT
and inline assembly, it's fine (within reason) for those nonportable
components to need changes for shadow stack support.

The objective of this proposal is to allow applications that do _not_
use inline assembly but rather only C APIs defined in POSIX.1-2004 to
execute correctly in an environment where shadow stacks are enabled
by default.

Possibly, but that's what SIGSTKSZ/MINSIGSTKSZ is for.  This is already
variable on several platforms due to variable-length vector extensions.

I appreciate that.  How far can we go in that direction?  If we can
automatically disable shadow stacks on any call to makecontext, sigaltstack,
or pthread_attr_setstack without causing other threads to crash if they were
in the middle of shadow stack maintenance we can probably simplify this
proposal, although I need to think more about what's possible.

How so?  Is the hard part figuring out if you need to do something, or
doing it?
