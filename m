As a result of the emails replying to this patch thread, I am now
starting to look at kselftest.  My level of understanding is based
on some slide presentations, an LWN article, https://kselftest.wiki.kernel.org/
and a _tiny_ bit of looking at kselftest code.

tl;dr; I don't really understand kselftest yet.


(1) why KUnit exists

(2) KUnit is not meant to replace kselftest

My understanding is that the intent of KUnit is to avoid booting a kernel on
real hardware or in a virtual machine.  That seems to be a matter of semantics
to me because isn't invoking a UML Linux just running the Linux kernel in
a different form of virtualization?

So I do not understand why KUnit is an improvement over kselftest.

It seems to me that KUnit is just another piece of infrastructure that I
am going to have to be familiar with as a kernel developer.  More overhead,
more information to stuff into my tiny little brain.

I would guess that some developers will focus on just one of the two test
environments (and some will focus on both), splitting the development
resources instead of pooling them on a common infrastructure.

What am I missing?
