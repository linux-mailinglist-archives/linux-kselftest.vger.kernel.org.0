Right, and you've already told us. A couple of times.

For example 
here https://lore.kernel.org/all/20190502074230.GA27847@kroah.com/

include/linux/livepatch.h and kernel/livepatch/core.c. See 
klp_{patch,object,func}.

It took some archeology, but I think 
https://lore.kernel.org/all/1464018848-4303-1-git-send-email-pmladek@suse.com/ 
is it. Petr might correct me.

It was long before we added some important features to the code, so it 
might be even more difficult today.

It resurfaced later when Tobin tried to fix some of kobject call sites in 
the kernel...

https://lore.kernel.org/all/20190430001534.26246-1-tobin@kernel.org/
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20190430233803.GB10777@eros.localdomain/
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20190502023142.20139-6-tobin@kernel.org/

There are probably more references.

Anyway, the current code works fine (well, one could argue about that). If 
someone wants to take a (another) stab at this, then why not, but it 
seemed like a rabbit hole without a substantial gain in the past. On the 
other hand, we currently misuse the API to some extent.

/me scratches head
