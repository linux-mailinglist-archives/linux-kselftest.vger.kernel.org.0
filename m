Oh, okay - I missed that! I had the impression that pages are unmovable 
and allocating from ZONE_MOVABLE would be a violation of that?

... and here you have your problem. That's a no-no. We only allow it in 
very special cases where it can't be avoided - e.g., vfio having to pin 
guest memory when passing through memory to VMs.

Hotplug memory, online it to ZONE_MOVABLE. Allocate secretmem. Try to 
unplug the memory again -> endless loop in offline_pages().

Or have a CMA area that gets used with GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE. Allocate 
secretmem. The owner of the area tries to allocate memory - always 
fails. Purpose of CMA destroyed.

That sounds like the proper way for me to do it then.

Oh, there is something: That the pages are not movable.
