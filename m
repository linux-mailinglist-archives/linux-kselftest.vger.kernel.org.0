Full disclaimer, about half of them are KUnit tests for KUnit - to
make sure KUnit works, so I don't know if you consider that cheating.

That's what I did on the this following paragraph (I just couldn't
time the tests by themselves in this case):

I agree, faster is almost always better in these types of things, and
certainly is in this case.

In fairness to you, I also short sold the speed of KUnit in the cover
letter. I was too lazy to do this complete of an analysis back when I
wrote it (even if I did a complete timing like this, I would have to
put a bunch of asterisks since it wouldn't include the time to "boot"
the kernel or to build it, which vastly outstrip the speed of
individual test cases). And given the original numbers, I think
speeding things up would probably seem more urgent. So no, I really
cannot blame you.

Sorry if it came across that I was frustrated or impatient, but I am
actually glad you asked because I now have this public email where I
did the full analysis of how fast KUnit really is which I can refer to
in the future.

Containers could definitely be useful in the long run. I have a long
term goal to build and run just parts of the kernel as I have
mentioned to you, and doing so in a totally hermetic environment could
provide a lot of value; in this case I would probably only want a
chroot, but if I want to deploy tests to run on different machines
containers could be very useful.

Actually, on the topic of containers for running tests, the presubmit
system I have set up for KUnit uses containers for deploying KUnit on
servers for testing[1]. Actually, I have some experimental patches to
make it work with LKML instead of Gerrit, but I am not sure whether it
makes more sense to go that route, with one of the many patchworks
clones that support presubmit, or something else.
