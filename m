To be clear it's what was asked for prior to the switch to the
forthcoming switch to the parsing idregs scheme, I haven't pulled in
your idregs work yet since it's being rapidly iterated and this is an
already large series with dependencies.

Actually now I think about it would you be open to merging the guest
context switching bit without the rest of the series (pending me fixing
the issues you raise of course)?  If so I'll split that bit out in the
hope that we can reduce the size of the series and CC list for the
userspace support which I imagine would make people a bit happier.

The style I'm referring to there is the style for documentation.

Ah, I see - yes, they should probably be moved somewhere else.  Though
I'm not clear why some of the other registers that we're saving and
restoring in the same place are being done eagerly?  The userspace
TPIDRs stand out for example, they're in taken care of in
__sysreg_save_user_state() which is called in the same paths.  IIRC my
thinking there was something along the lines of "this is where we save
and restore everything else that's just a general system register, I
should be consistent".

Am I right in thinking kvm_arch_vcpu_load()/_put() would make sense?
Everything in there currently looked like it was there more due to doing
something more complex than simple register save/restore and we weren't
worrying too much about what was going on with just the sysregs.

Great, that's what I'd thought thanks - I hadn't checked yet.
