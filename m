My meaning is clear: it is not unexpected, so it is expected.

OK, not see any failure when running single zram02.sh after applying my
patch V2.

crash can't be observed with my patch V2, what do you mean 'stall'
the module? Is that 'zram' can't be unloaded after the test is
terminated via multiple 'ctrl-c'?

ltp/zram02.sh has cleanup handler via trap to clean everything(swapoff/umount/reset/
rmmod), ctrl-c will terminate current forground task and cause shell to run the
cleanup handler first, but further 'ctrl-c' will terminate the cleanup handler,
then the cleanup won't be done completely, such as zram disk is left as swap
device and zram can't be unloaded. The idea can be observed via the following
script:

	#!/bin/bash
	trap 'echo "enter trap"; sleep 20; echo "exit trap";' INT
	sleep 30

After the above script is run foreground, when 1st ctrl-c is pressed, 'sleep 30'
is terminated, then the trap command is run, so you can see "enter trap"
dumped. Then if you pressed 2nd ctrl-c, 'sleep 20' is terminated immediately.
So 'swapoff' from zram02.sh's trap function can be terminated in this way.

zram disk being left as swap disk can be observed with your patch too
after terminating via multiple ctrl-c which has to be done this way because
the test is dead loop.

So it is hard to cleanup everything completely after multiple 'CTRL-C' is
involved, and it should be impossible. It needs violent multiple ctrl-c to
terminate the dealoop test.

So it isn't reasonable to expect that zram can be always unloaded successfully
after the test script is terminated via multiple ctrl-c.

But zram can be unloaded after running swapoff manually, from driver
viewpoint, nothing is wrong.
