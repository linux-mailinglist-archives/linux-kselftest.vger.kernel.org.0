Ah I think I see what you wanted to do now.. But I'm afraid it won't work
for all cases.

So IIUC the problem is anon pte can be empty, but since uffd-wp bit doesn't
persist on anon (but none) ptes, then we got it lost and we cannot identify
it from pages being written.  Your solution will solve problem for
anonymous, but I think it'll break file memories.

Example:

Consider one shmem page that got mapped, write protected (using UFFDIO_WP
ioctl), written again (removing uffd-wp bit automatically), then zapped.
The pte will be pte_none() but it's actually written, afaiu.

Maybe it's time we should introduce UFFD_FEATURE_WP_ZEROPAGE, so we'll need
to install pte markers for anonymous too (then it will work similarly like
shmem/hugetlbfs, that we'll report writting to zero pages), then you'll
need to have the new UFFD_FEATURE_WP_ASYNC depend on it.  With that I think
you can keep using the old check and it should start to work.

Please let me know if my understanding is correct above.

I'll see whether I can quickly play with UFFD_FEATURE_WP_ZEROPAGE with some
patch at the meantime.  That's something we wanted before too, when the app
cares about zero pages on anon.  We used to populate the pages before doing
ioctl(UFFDIO_WP) to make sure zero pages will be repoted too, but that flag
should be more efficient.

I think there's a loop to copy_to_user().  Could you use the new helper so
the copy_to_user() loop will work without export_prev_to_out()?

I really hope we can get rid of export_prev_to_out().  Thanks,
