I think you missed the fact that the code doesn't wait for all open file
handles to be closed. It waits for all in-progress syscalls to return
from the driver. That's a big difference.

What I don't want to see is drivers using this new API directly to
protect the cdev race. That would be a big step in the wrong direction.
Patch 5/5 needs to move driver code to the cdev level. That shouldn't be
difficult, so I really not see why it can't be done in v4 to see how it
will look like.

No, drivers should *not* do that manually. That's a recipe for disaster
that we would regret later.
