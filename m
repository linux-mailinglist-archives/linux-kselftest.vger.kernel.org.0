I see. But this'll not work as we need to count p->cur to don't go above
the maximum count, p->vec_size.

I've made it a separate function to make the code look better in the caller
function and logically easier to understand. This function is ugly.
do_pagemap_scan() is also already very long function with lots of things
happening. If you still insist, I'll remove this function.

First of all, caching is avoided as then state maintained is needed. This
is probably not accepted in Wine upstream later. Secondly, even if we have
cache, Get + WP operation would not be accurate when we ask only N pages,
but it gets N + X pages where X pages will not be consumed by the
application at this time.

Clever!! This looks very sleek.

Other functions in this file handle the THP in this same way. So it feels
like more intuitive that we follow to same pattern in this file.

-ENOSPC --> user buffer has been filled completely
PM_SCAN_FOUND_MAX_PAGES --> max_pages have been found, user buffer may
