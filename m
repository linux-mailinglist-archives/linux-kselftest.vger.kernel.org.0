In practice, difference between results got with CLOCK_MONOTONIC and 
CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW
actually is too little to be visible. But if just in theory, 
CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW can ensure time results
of the compared tests are based on the same local oscillator frequency, 
which is not subject to possible
NTP frequency adjustment. Change in this patch seems like a bit of 
optimization.

But either of these two flags is good to me. If this patch is not 
convincing enough to be accepted, I will
post a patch later in fix use of CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW in 
kvm_page_table_test.c just to be consistent
with other kvm tests, please queue. :ï¼‰

Thanks,
Yanan
