You are right, Frank: the EXPECT_* and ASSERT_* in kselftest_harness.h
is for userspace only. kselftest_harness.h provides it's own main method
for running the tests[1]. It also makes assumptions around having access
to this main method[2].

There actually isn't that much infrastructure that that I can reuse
there. I can't even reuse the API definitions because they only pass the
context object (for me it is struct kunit, for them it is their fixture)
that they use to their test cases.

I think I agree with this point. I cannot see any reason not to have
KUnit tests able to be run from the kselftest harness.

Conceptually, I think we are mostly in agreement that kselftest and
KUnit are distinct things. Like Shuah said, kselftest is a black box
regression test framework, KUnit is a white box unit testing framework.
So making kselftest the only interface to use KUnit would be a mistake
in my opinion (and I think others on this thread would agree).

That being said, when you go to run kselftest, I think there is an
expectation that you run all your tests. Or at least that kselftest
should make that possible. From my experience, usually when someone
wants to run all the end-to-end tests, *they really just want to run all
the tests*. This would imply that all your KUnit tests get run too.

Another added benefit of making it possible for the kselftest harness to
run KUnit tests would be that it would somewhat guarantee that the
interfaces between the two would remain compatible meaning that test
automation tools like CI and presubmit systems are more likely to be
easy to integrate in each and less likely to break for either.

Would anyone object if I explore this in a follow-up patchset? I have an
idea of how I might start, but I think it would be easiest to explore in
it's own patchset. I don't expect it to be a trivial amount of work.

Cheers!
