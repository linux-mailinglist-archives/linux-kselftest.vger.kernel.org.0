Right.

Yes, then what is the problem here wrt. kobject_put() which may not be
synchronous?

Right, that is exactly how klp_patch kobject is implemented. klp_patch
kobject has to be disabled first, then module refcnt can be dropped after
the klp_patch kobject is released. Then module_exit() is possible.
