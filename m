OK so that is when the memory is faulted in. Good that is a standard
model we have. The memcg context of the creator of the secret memory is
not really important. So whoever has created is not charged.

so effectivelly when they are unmapped, right? This is similar to
anonymous memory.

As I've said it would be really great to have this life cycle documented
properly.

What kind of churn you have in mind? What is the downside?

What does really prevent a larger use with this implementation?
