The only symbol we need in core kunit from the kernel when compiling kunit 
as a module is sysctl_hung_task_timeout_secs; it's a core kernel symbol.
There's no issue with symbols within kunit in this case.
 
I've come up with a new way to handle variables and functions in the 
v3 patch set 3 [1] I've sent out. While not being perfect, it attempts to 
satisfy some of the requirements you describe below.   It will generate 
compiler errors if there is a mismatch between local symbol definition and 
the target symbol type.

Symbol variable definitions are handled such that the same symbol name can 
be used; see try-catch.c in patch 5 where we assign 
sysctl_hung_task_timeout_secs.

Unfortunately the same scheme won't work for functions. The reason for 
this is we've already #included a definiton of the function, so if we 
attempt to redefine that same name as a function pointer we get a 
compile-time that we are redefining the symbol.  As a consequence the
approach I took is for us to define a local function pointer and it gets
assigned either to

 - the results of kunit_find_symbol() (module case)
 - the function itself (builtin case)

The latter will trigger a compile-time error if our local definition is 
out of sync.

see above - kunit needs a non-exported global kernel symbol 
(sysctl_hung_task_timeout_secs).

See above; if compiled as builtin compiler errors will be generated.
