Wouldn't this work?

make CFLAGS_x86=-fno-stack-protector nolibc-test

Or we do 

CFLAGS_STACKPROTECTOR ?= $(call cc-option,-mstack-protector-guard=global $(call cc-option,-fstack-protector-all))
CFLAGS ?= ... $(CFLAGS_STACKPROTECTOR)

And then it is always:

make CFLAGS_STACKPROTECTOR= nolibc-test

An alternative would also be to use a GCC 9 compatible mechanism:

#if __has_attribute(no_stack_protector)
#define __no_stack_protector __attribute__((no_stack_protector))
#else
#define __no_stack_protector __attribute__((__optimize__("-fno-stack-protector")))
#endif

Or we combine CFLAGS_STACKPROTECTOR and __no_stack_protector.

To be honest I was happy to get rid of all these architecture specific
variables.

I trimmed the list a bit.
