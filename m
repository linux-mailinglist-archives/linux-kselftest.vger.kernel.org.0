This section talk about "access rights that only apply to the content of 
a directory, not the directory itself", which is not correct (see 
LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_DIR). I'd like these access rights to remain 
here but this kernel patch and the related tests need some changes.

What about a LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_CHGRP? I'm not sure if we need to 
differentiate these actions or not, but we need arguments to choose.

This is not a "dir" but a "path".

Same here.

Good point. For an initial chmod/chown/chgrp access right, I'd prefer to 
be able to set these access rights on a directory but only for its 
content, not the directory itself. I think it is much safer and should 
be enough for the majority of use cases, but let me know if I'm missing 
something. I'm not sure being able to change the root directory access 
rights may be a good idea anyway (even for containers). ;)

A path_beneath rule enables to identify a file hierarchy (i.e. the 
content of a directory), not to make modifications visible outside of 
the directory identifying the hierarchy (hence the "parent_fd" field), 
which would be the case with the current chmod/chown access rights.

This kind of option is interesting. For now, some access rights are kind 
of "doubled" to enable to differentiate between a file and a directory 
(i.e. READ_DIR/READ_FILE, REMOVE_DIR/REMOVE_FILE, WRITE_FILE/MAKE_*) 
when it may be useful, but this is different.

I think this "strictly beneath" behavior should be the default, which is 
currently the case.

This is the kind of questions that made such access rights not 
appropriate for the initial version of Landlock. But we should talk 
about that now.

I'll make sure to only have one ABI version bump per kernel release, but 
it is OK to bump it for this patch series in case it is not ready for 
the next merge window. I'll change it if required when merging into my 
tree. It is easier to change the code to decrease the version, so please 
keep it as is. ;)
