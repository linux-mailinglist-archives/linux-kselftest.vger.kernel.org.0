Thanks! I also appreciate a lot your guidance and suggestions.

Oh, I remember well, it is there but difficult to spot...

Ok, we will come back to you about this.

Ok, given that there is the comment in the Makefile, the last thing to
do from your side is to remove the vague comment in the file_release
patch.

Other than that, I think Mimi wanted to give a last look. If that is
ok, then the patches should be ready for your repo and linux-next.

Thanks
