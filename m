Maybe the above is where we have disagreement:
Do we still need make dma-bufs look like struct page to mm subsystem?
IMHO, the answer is no. We might only need to make dma-bufs look like
struct page to net stack and page pool subsystem. I think that is already
what this pacthset is trying to do, what I am suggesting is just make
it more like 'struct page' to net stack and page pool subsystem, in order
to try to avoid most of the 'if' checking in net stack and page pool
subsystem.

As far as I tell, as we limit the devmem usage in netstack, the below
is the related mm function call for 'struct page' for devmem:
page_ref_*(): page->_refcount does not need changing
page_is_pfmemalloc(): which is corresponding to page->pp_magic, and
                      devmem provider can set/unset it in it's 'alloc_pages'
                      ops.
page_to_nid(): we may need to handle it differently somewhat like this
               patch does as page_to_nid() may has different implementation
               based on different configuration.
page_pool_iov_put_many(): as mentioned in other thread, if net stack is not
                          calling page_pool_page_put_many() directly, we
                          can reuse napi_pp_put_page() for devmem too, and
                          handle the special case for devmem in 'release_page'
                          ops.

As what I suggested above, Can we handle this in devmem provider's
'release_page' ops instead of calling put_page() directly as for devmem.

As we have added a few checkings to limit 'struct page' for devmem to
be only used in net stack, we can decouple 'struct page' for devmem
from mm subsystem, zone_device_data() is not really needed, right?

If we can decouple 'struct page' for normal memory from mm subsystem
through the folio work in the future, then we may define a more abstract
structure for page pool and net stack instead of reusing 'struct page'
from mm.
