I'm not sure I understand.
Do you want to stay compatible with c89/gnu89?

If so we could use that baseline standard instead of -std=c99.

Without specifying a standard we get whatever the compiler uses as
default which is probably much newer than c99.

Having two targets seems to be easy to do but I'm not sure what the
advantage would be over compiling once against the intended baseline
standard.

Thomas
