Are you referring to ioctl? I think this syscall can be used in future
for adding other operations like soft-dirty. This is why syscall has
been added.

If community doesn't agree, I can translate this syscall to the ioctl
same as it is.

The cycles are given in thousands. 60 means 60k cycles here which have
been measured with rdtsc().

|   | Region size in Pages | 1    | 10   | 100   | 1000  | 10000  |
|---|----------------------|------|------|-------|-------|--------|
| 1 | MEMWATCH             | 7    | 58   | 281   | 1178  | 17563  |
| 2 | MEMWATCH Perf        | 4    | 23   | 107   | 1331  | 8924   |
| 3 | USERFAULTFD          | 5405 | 6550 | 10387 | 55708 | 621522 |
| 4 | MPROTECT_SEGV        | 35   | 611  | 1060  | 6646  | 60149  |

1. MEMWATCH --> process_memwatch considering VM_SOFTDIRT (splitting is
possible)
2. MEMWATCH Perf --> process_memwatch without considering VM_SOFTDIRTY
3. Userafaultfd --> userfaultfd with handling is userspace
4. Mprotect_segv --> mprotect and signal handler in userspace

Note: Implementation of mprotect_segv is very similar to userfaultfd. In
both of these, the signal/fault is being handled in the userspace. In
mprotect_segv, the memory region is write-protected through mprotect and
SEGV signal is received when something is written to this region. This
signal's handler is where we do calculations about soft dirty pages.
Mprotect_segv mechanism must be lighter than userfaultfd inside kernel.

My benchmark application is purely single threaded to keep effort to a
minimum until we decide to spend more time. It has been written to
measure the time taken in a serial execution of these statements without
locks. If the multi-threaded application is used and randomization is
introduced, it should affect `MPROTECT_SEGV` and `userfaultd`
implementations more than memwatch. But in this particular setting,
memwatch and mprotect_segv perform closely.

Clearing soft-dirty bit for a range of memory may result in splitting
the VMA. Soft-dirty bit of the per page need to be cleared. The
VM_SOFTDIRTY flag from this splitted VMA need to be cleared. The kernel
may decide to merge this splitted VMA back. Please note that kernel
doesn't take into account the VM_SOFTDIRTY flag of the VMAs when it
decides to merge the VMAs. This not only gives performance hit, but also
the non-dirty pages of the whole VMA start to appear as dirty again
after the VMA merging. To avoid this penalty,
MEMWATCH_SD_NO_REUSED_REGIONS flag has been added to ignore the
VM_SOFTDIRTY and just rely on the soft-dirty bit present on the per
page. The user is aware about the constraint that the new regions will
not be found dirty if this flag is specified.
