Right, we need changes for setjmp()/longjmp() for example.

Yeah, it'd be good to understand.  I've been through quite a lot of old
versions of the x86 series (I've not found them all, there's 30 versions
or something of the old series plus the current one is on v9) and the
code always appears to have been this way with changelogs that explain
the what but not the why.  For example roughly the current behaviour was
already in place in v10 of the original series:

   https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/20200429220732.31602-26-yu-cheng.yu@intel.com/

I do worry about the story for users calling the underlying clone3() API
(or legacy clone() for that matter) directly, and we would also need to
handle the initial GCS enable via prctl() - that's not insurmountable,
we could add a size argument there that only gets interpreted during the
initial enable for example.

My sense is that they deployment story is going to be smoother with
defaults being provided since it avoids dealing with the issue of what
to do if userspace creates a thread without a GCS in a GCS enabled
process but like I say I'd be totally happy to extend clone3().  I will
put some patches together for that (probably once the x86 stuff lands).
Given the size of this series it might be better split out for
manageability if nothing else.
