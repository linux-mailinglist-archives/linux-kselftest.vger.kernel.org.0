I didn't mean that secretmem should not support sealing. I meant that
MFD_ALLOW_SEALING flag does not make sense. Unlike tmpfs, the secretmem fd
does not need protection from somebody unexpectedly sealing it.

Nowadays adding a new syscall is not as costly as it used to be. And I
think it'll provide better extensibility when new features would be added
to secretmem. 

For instance, for creating a secretmem fd backed with sealing we'd have

	memfd_secretm(SECRETMEM_HUGE);

rather than

	memfd_create(MFD_ALLOW_SEALING | MFD_HUGETLB | MFD_SECRET);


Besides, if we overload memfd_secret we add complexity to flags validation
of allowable flag combinations even with the simplest initial
implementation.
And what it will become when more features are added to secretmem?

I don't have any implicit knowledge, we just have a different perspective.
