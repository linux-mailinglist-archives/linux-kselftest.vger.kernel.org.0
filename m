I have a different opinion about providing stability guarantees; I 
believe it is safe to provide such a guarantee without actual use in a 
field. We develop features expecting there are real uses, and if it 
turns out otherwise, we can break the stated guarantee since there is no 
real use cases anyway. It is fine even breaking UAPIs in such a case, 
which is stated in Documentation/admin-guide/reporting-regressions.rst.

So I rather feel easy about guaranteeing UAPI stability; we can just 
guarantee the UAPI-level stability for a particular kfunc and use it 
from QEMU expecting the stability. If the feature is found not useful, 
QEMU and the kernel can just remove it.

I'm more concerned about the other case, which means that there will be 
wide uses of this feature. A kernel developer may assume the stability 
of the interface is like one of kernel internal APIs 
(Documentation/bpf/kfuncs.rst says kfuncs are like EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL) 
and decide to change it, breaking old QEMU binaries and that's something 
I would like to avoid.

Regarding the breakage scenario, I think we can avoid the kfuncs removal 
just by saying "we won't remove them". I'm more worried the case that a 
change in the BPF kfunc infrastucture requires to recompile the binary.

So, in short, I don't think we can say "kfuncs are like 
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL" and "you can freely use kfuncs in a normal userspace 
application like QEMU" at the same time.

Yes, it's option 3.

I'd like to add a documentation change to say the added kfuncs are 
exceptional cases that are not like EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL in that case. Will 
it work?
