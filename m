Thanks - appeciated!

Although I agree it might be a tall order create and mount an XFS fs in
run_vmtests.sh. Perhaps it might be good enough to add an optional param to the
test to pass a path when running the test manually, and if that's not provided,
just try to create a temp file in the current dir and skip if its not the right
sort of fs?
