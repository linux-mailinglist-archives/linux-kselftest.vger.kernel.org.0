Unfortunately that patch adds new deadlock between hot_remove_store() and
disksize_store() & others, see my below comment.

IMO, yes, in your patch of 'zram: fix crashes with cpu hotplug multistate',
when you added mutex_lock(zram_index_mutex) to disksize_store() and
other attribute show() or store() method. You have added new deadlock
between hot_remove_store() and disksize_store() & others, which can't be
addressed by your approach of holding module refcnt.

So far not see ltp tests covers hot add/remove interface yet.
