So, with this the inode-test.c will have the following output, right?

TAP version 14
1..7
    # Subtest: ext4_inode_test
    1..1
    # inode_test_xtimestamp_decoding: ok 0 - param-0
    # inode_test_xtimestamp_decoding: ok 1 - param-1
    # inode_test_xtimestamp_decoding: ok 2 - param-2
    # inode_test_xtimestamp_decoding: ok 3 - param-3
    # inode_test_xtimestamp_decoding: ok 4 - param-4
    # inode_test_xtimestamp_decoding: ok 5 - param-5
    # inode_test_xtimestamp_decoding: ok 6 - param-6
    # inode_test_xtimestamp_decoding: ok 7 - param-7
    # inode_test_xtimestamp_decoding: ok 8 - param-8
    # inode_test_xtimestamp_decoding: ok 9 - param-9
    # inode_test_xtimestamp_decoding: ok 10 - param-10
    # inode_test_xtimestamp_decoding: ok 11 - param-11
    # inode_test_xtimestamp_decoding: ok 12 - param-12
    # inode_test_xtimestamp_decoding: ok 13 - param-13
    # inode_test_xtimestamp_decoding: ok 14 - param-14
    # inode_test_xtimestamp_decoding: ok 15 - param-15
    ok 1 - inode_test_xtimestamp_decoding
ok 1 - ext4_inode_test

I will send another patch with this change.
Thanks!
