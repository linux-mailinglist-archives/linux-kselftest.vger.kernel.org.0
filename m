and I guess I then have to apoligize for missing your email ;).  Hopefully that
was the problem, but who knows.

OK.  So you just send the FD around using one of the standard mechanisms to
orchestrate the handoff?  I guess that might work for our use case, assuming
whatever the security side of things was doing was OK with the old FD.  TBH I'm
not sure how all that works and while we thought about doing that sort of
transfer scheme we decided to just open it again -- not sure how far we were
down the dm-user rabbit hole at that point, though, as this sort of arose out
of some other ideas.

I was really experting someone to say that.  It does seem kind of silly to build
out the new interface, but not go all the way to a ring buffer.  We just didn't
really have any way to justify the extra complexity as our use cases aren't
that high performance.   I kind of like to have benchmarks for this sort of
thing, though, and I didn't have anyone who had bothered avoiding the last copy
to compare against.

Ya, it's in Android already and we'll be shipping it as part of the new OTA
flow for the next release.  The rules on deprecation are a bit different over
there, though, so it's not like we're wed to it.  The whole point of bringing
this up here was to try and get something usable by everyone, and while I'd
eventually like to get whatever's in Android into the kernel proper we'd really
planned on supporting an extra Android-only ABI for a cycle at least.  

I'm kind of inclined to take a crack at the extra copy, to at least see if
building something that eliminates it is viable.  I'm not really sure if it is
(or at least, if it'll net us a meaningful amount of performance), but it'd at
least be interesting to try.

It'd be nice to have some benchmark target, though, as otherwise this stuff
hangs on forever.  My workloads are in selftests later on in the patch set, but
I'm essentially using tmpfs as a baseline to compare against ext4+dm-user with
some FIO examples as workloads.  Our early benchmark numbers indicated this was
way faster than we needed, so I didn't even bother putting together a proper
system to run on so I don't really have any meaningful numbers there.  Is there
an NBD server that's fast that I should be comparing against?

I haven't gotten a whole lot of feedback, so I'm inclined to at least have some
reasonable performance numbers before bothering with a v2.
