I recommend to not look at the zram driver, instead look at the
test_sysfs driver as that abstracts the issue more clearly and uses
two different locks as an example. The point is that if on module
removal *any* lock is used which is *also* used on the sysfs file
created by the module, you can deadlock.

No, the reason this can deadlock is that the module exit routine will
patiently wait for the sysfs / kernfs files to be stop being used,
but clearly they cannot if the exit routine took the mutex also used
by the sysfs ops. That is, the special condition here is the removal of
the sysfs files, and the sysfs files using a lock also used on module
exit.
