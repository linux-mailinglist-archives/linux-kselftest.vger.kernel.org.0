I'll remove.

Okay. I'll add the documentation in next version or after the series has
been accepted. Initially I'd added the documentation. But the code kept on
changing so much that I had to spend considerable time on updating the
documentation. I know it is better to add documentation with the patches.
I'll try to add it.

Initially, we just wanted a way to emulate Windows API GetWriteWatch(). So
we had added `max_pages` in the IOCTL arguments which is optional and can
be used to specify how many pages we want to find of our interest. There
was only one set of flags to be matched with the pages.

Then, CRIU developers Andrea [1] and Danylo [2], asked to include all these
different kinds of masks. I'd thought of these masks as fancy filter inside
the kernel. But there wasn't anyone else to review. So I'd included them to
move forward. Please let me know your thoughts after reading emails from [1].

Correct.

The filtering is being done. But the output can still be condensed
regardless. There isn't that randomness in the page flags of the
consecutive pages.

"Atomic fetch and update/clear" or "Atomic fetch Written-to status and
clear it" is needed to support GetWriteWatch() and there is no already
present way to perform this operation atomically. We want efficiency and
accuracy both to get good performance/speed. So this IOCTL is needed to
achieve:
1) New functionality which isn't already present
2) Most efficient and accurate method to perform the operation (it isn't
possible through soft-dirty feature)
