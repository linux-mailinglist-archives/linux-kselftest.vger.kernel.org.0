v2 is trying to wait until all active calls finishes before changing or
deactivating this particular stub, I've also added simple test for it:

renamed to KUNIT_GLOBAL_STUB_REDIRECT

as in v2 there is a dedicated struct/union to hold the address and the
type of the replacement function, I've also added there a kunit* so is
now everything is logged to the test log

yes, as we want automatic deactivation of the stub to avoid leaving
active stub after the test ends (may be important if using KUnit for
some live testing, like we do in Xe)

we usually enable/activate stubs from the test case code, where kunit*
is already there, so this just enforces that redirection could be
controlled only from the main KUnit thread

v2 is using READ_ONCE()/WRITE_ONCE() to update stub pointers and
atomic_t to track whether stub is disabled(0) or activated(1) or in_use(2+)
