I'm not entirely sure what point you are making here. Yes an LD_PRELOAD
approach could be used instead of a personality type as a 'hack' to
preallocate the upper address space. The obvious disadvantage is that
you can't (easily) layer LD_PRELOAD so it won't work in the general case.

My issue with the existing 'solutions' is that they all seem to be fragile:

 * Using /proc/self/maps is inherently racy if there could be any other
code running in the process at the same time.

 * Attempting to map the upper part of the address space only works if
done early enough - once an allocation arrives there, there's very
little you can robustly do (because the stray allocation might be freed).

 * LuaJIT's probing mechanism is probably robust, but it's inefficient -
LuaJIT has a fallback of linear probing, following by no hint (ASLR),
followed by pseudo-random probing. I don't know the history of the code
but it looks like it's probably been tweaked to try to avoid performance
issues.

Obviously if you actually exhaust the lower limit then any
MAP_BELOW_HINT API would also fail - there's really not much that can be
done in that case.

My intention is to show that today's API doesn't provide a robust way of
doing this. Although I'm quite happy if you can point me at a robust way
with the current API. As I mentioned my goal is to be able to map memory
in a (multithreaded) library with a (ideally configurable) number of VA
bits. I don't particularly want to restrict the whole process, just
specific allocations.

I had typed up a series similar to this one as a MAP_BELOW flag would
fit my use-case well.

The riscv issue is a different issue to the one I'm trying to solve. I
agree MAP_BELOW_HINT isn't a great fix for that because we already have
differences between amd64 and arm64 and obviously no software currently
out there uses this new flag.

However, if we had introduced this flag in the past (e.g. if MAP_32BIT
had been implemented more generically, across architectures and with a
hint value, like this new flag) then we probably wouldn't be in this
situation. Applications that want to restrict the VA space would be able
to opt-in and be portable across architectures.

Another potential option is a mmap3() which actually allows the caller
to place constraints on the VA space (e.g. minimum, maximum and
alignment). There's plenty of code out there that has to over-allocate
and munmap() the unneeded part for alignment reasons. But I don't have a
specific need for that, and I'm guessing you wouldn't be in favour.

Thanks,
Steve
