Yeah, yeah, I know, but it is a lot easier for me to get a project set
up here using Gerrit, when we already use that for a lot of other
projects.

Also, Gerrit has gotten a lot better over the last two years or so. Two
years ago, I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole. It's not so bad
anymore, at least if you are used to using a web UI to review code.

Oh, I didn't realize that. I found your patchwork instance here[5], but
do you have a place where I can see the changes you have added to
support presubmit?

I checked out a couple of your projects on your patchwork instance: AMD
X.Org drivers, DRI devel, and Wayland. I saw the tab you added for
tests, but none of them actually had any test results. Can you point me
at one that does?

Cheers!
