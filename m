Here is another strange but real-live scenario: crash handler for dumping core.

If applications has network connections it would be better to close them all,
otherwise clients will wait until end of dumping process or timeout.
Also closing normal files might be a good idea for releasing locks.

But simple closing might race with other threads - closed fd will be reused
while some code still thinks it refers to original file.

Our solution closes files without freeing fd: it opens /dev/null and
replaces all opened descriptors using dup2.

So, special flag for close_range() could close files without clearing bitmap.
Effect should be the same - fd wouldn't be reused.

Actually two flags for two phases: closing files and releasing fd.

It would be better to split arch/ wiring into separate patch for better readability.
