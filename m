I've also seen no suggestion that general purpose distros are considering
GCS -- that's what I'm asking about here, and also saying that we shouldn't
rush in an ABI without confidence that it actually works beyond unit tests
(although it's great that you wrote selftests!).

This sounds compelling, but has anybody tried running significant parts of a
distribution (e.g. running Debian source package tests, booting Android,
using a browser, running QEMU) with GCS enabled? I can well imagine
non-trivial applications violating both assumptions of the architecture and
the ABI.

Again, this sounds plausible but I don't see any data to back it up so I
don't really have a feeling as to how true it is.

I'm not saying we should wait until distros are committed, but Arm should
be able to do that work on a fork, exactly like we did for the arm64
bringup. We have the fastmodel, so running interesting stuff with GCS
enabled should be dead easy, no?

Ok, so it sounds like you've started something then? How far have you got?

While we'd be daft not to look at what the x86 folks are doing, I don't
think we should rely solely on them to inform the design for arm64 when
it should be relatively straightforward to prototype the distro work on
the model. There's also no rush to land the kernel changes given that
GCS hardware doesn't exist.
