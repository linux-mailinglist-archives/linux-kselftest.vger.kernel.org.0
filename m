Because the routine try_module_get() assumes the struct module pointer
is valid for the entire call. That can only be true if at least one
reference is held prior to this call.

Yes but only with the above care addressed.

That is exactly what I intended to clarify with that example, yes, a
reference is held but this is done implicitly. *If* a kernfs op is
active module removal waits for that active reference to go down. So
while a kernfs file is being used it is simply not possible for the
module to disappear underneath us. And the reason is that the module
that created the sysfs file must obviously destroy that same sysfs file.
But since kernfs ensures that sysfs file cannot be removed if a sysfs
file is being used, this implicitly holds a module reference.

Let me know if y ou can think of a better way to phrase this.

Sure thing.
