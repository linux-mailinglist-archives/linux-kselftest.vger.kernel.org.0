I find it a little clearer that it's a per thread stack here but sure.

Yes, there is no unlock prctl() - the lock prctl() just lets you set
locks.

If something was in the middle of looking the GCS (eg, you're trying to
disable GCS during signal handling that preempted something that is
logging the call stack) and you pull the GCS storage from underneath it
then things will go badly.

We have to work out where to point GCSPR_EL0 when reenabling - at the
top of the old stack, where it was before, on a new stack?  It was
easier to just not support reenabling than to work out what the sensible
answer is when it's not clear that any real use case exists to inform
what makes sense.  We can add support for that later (you can probe by
starting a thread, disabling and trying to reenable) if someone does
come up with a use case.

The use case for disabling is a non-enforcing mode which logs GCS faults
and then disables GCS.

It's actually based on bitrot that I'd initially chosen a smaller value
since it's likely that functions will push at least something as you
suggest, the patches now just use RLIMIT_STACK.  I'll fix.

Yes, it was meant to say when the thread is freed rather than when GCS
is disabled.

You have a draft version of the spec, this was changed and now there is
now a token field reserved in the low 12 bits of the register:

#define GCS_CAP_ADDR_MASK		GENMASK(63, 12)
#define GCS_CAP_ADDR_SHIFT		12
#define GCS_CAP_ADDR_WIDTH		52
#define GCS_CAP_ADDR(x)			FIELD_GET(GCS_CAP_ADDR_MASK, x)

#define GCS_CAP_TOKEN_MASK		GENMASK(11, 0)
#define GCS_CAP_TOKEN_SHIFT		0
#define GCS_CAP_TOKEN_WIDTH		12
#define GCS_CAP_TOKEN(x)		FIELD_GET(GCS_CAP_TOKEN_MASK, x)

#define GCS_CAP_VALID_TOKEN		0x1
#define GCS_CAP_IN_PROGRESS_TOKEN	0x5

#define GCS_CAP(x)	((((unsigned long)x) & GCS_CAP_ADDR_MASK) | \
					       GCS_CAP_VALID_TOKEN)
