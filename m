Why would you want to add this error check? If a user requires
multiple flags but cares only about a list of matching pages, then it
would be natural to express this intent as return_mask =3D 0.

Ok, I believe the misunderstanding comes from the naming. I "require"
the flag to be a particular value - hence include it in
"required_flags" and specify the required value in ~negated_flags. You
"require" the flag to be set (equal 1) and so include it in
"required_flags" and you "require" the flag to be clear (equal to 0)
so include it in "excluded_flags". Both approaches are correct, but I
would not consider one "easier" than the other. The former is more
general, though - makes any_of also able to match on flags cleared and
removes the possibility of a conflicting case of a flag present in
both sets.

Maybe considered_flags or matched_flags then would make the field
better understandable?
