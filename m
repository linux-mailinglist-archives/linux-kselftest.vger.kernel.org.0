KERN_CONT does not guarantee that the message will get printed
together. The pieces get interleaved with messages printed in
parallel.

Note that KERN_CONT was originally really meant to be used only during
boot. It was later used more widely and ended in the best effort category.

There were several attempts to make it more reliable. But it was
always either too complicated or error prone or both.

You need to use your own buffering if you rely want perfect output.
The question is if it is really worth the complexity. Also note that
any buffering reduces the chance that the messages will reach
the console.

BTW: There is a work in progress on a lockless printk ring buffer.
It will make printk() more secure regarding deadlocks. But it might
make transparent handling of continuous lines even more tricky.

I guess that local buffering, before calling printk(), will be
even more important then. Well, it might really force us to create
an API for it.

IMHO, ftrace postpones the text formatting primary because it does not
not want to slow down the traced code more than necessary. It is yet
another layer and there should be some strong reason for it.

Note that stroring the messages into the printk log is basically safe in any
context. It uses temporary per-CPU buffers for recursive messages and
in NMI. The only problem is panic() when some CPU gets stuck with the
lock taken. This will get solved by the lockless ringbuffer. Also
the temporary buffers will not be necessary any longer.

Much bigger problems are with consoles. There are many of them. It
means a lot of code and more locks involved, including scheduler
locks. Note that console lock is a semaphore.
