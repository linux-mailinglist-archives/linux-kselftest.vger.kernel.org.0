I was going to send a new version changing the whole thing to be struct
path based (and adding FSCONFIG_SET_PATH{,_EMPTY} support) so we don't
need to allocate a file explicitly for the non-FSCONFIG_SET_FD case, but
we can do that as a follow-up I guess.

That sounds fine, I wasn't quite sure what to do with fc->user_ns to be
honest. Being more conservative is probably the right call here.

The main issues are:

1. pid1 can often be non-dumpable, which can block you from doing that.
   In principle, because the dumpable flag is reset on execve, it is
   theoretically possible to get access to /proc/$pid/ns/pid if you win
   the race in a pid namespace with lots of process activity, but this
   kind of sucks.

2. This approach doesn't work for empty pid namesapces.
   pidns_for_children doesn't let you get a handle to an empty pid
   namespace either (I briefly looked at the history and it seems this
   was silently changed in v2 of the patchset based on some feedback
   that I'm not sure was entirely correct).

3. Now that you can configure the procfs mount, it seems like a
   half-baked interface to not provide diagnostic information about the
   namespace. (I suspect the criu folks would be happy to have this too
   ;).)
