Sure, I think this probably makes sense -- I'm still getting my around
which parts of the design are directly related to MTE and which aren't.

I was a bit concerned about the interaction between
PR_SET_TAGGED_ADDR_CTRL and the sysctl: the caller might conclude that
this API is unavailable when actually tagged addresses are stuck on.

I'm not sure whether this matters, but it's a bit weird.

One option would be to change the semantics, so that the sysctl just
forbids turning tagging from off to on.  Alternatively, we could return
a different error code to distinguish this case.

Or we just leave it as proposed.

Cheers
