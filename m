Well, copying them in now.  The discussion here is about allocation of
shadow stacks for the arm64 implementation of the feature (the arm64
feature is called Guarded Control Stack in the architecture).  These
maintain a second copy of the stack with only the return targets in
memory allocated with special protections so userspace can't write to it
directly and use this when doing returns to ensure that the returns
haven't been redirected.  These shadow stacks can be allocated directly
by userspace using a new system call map_shadow_stack(), doing this via
mmap() was extensively discussed but it was concluded that this was very
likely to lead to security problems so we've got this new syscall that
ensures that shadow stack memory is never accessible to userspace via
other means.

The x86 implementation that has already been merged into mainline will
allocate a new shadow stack for newly created threads when the creating
thread has one.  There was a suggestion to have arm64 diverge and
require that threads be created with clone3() and manualy provide a
shadow stack but then concerns were raised that as well as the issues
with divergence this would be too disruptive for adoption due to
non-libc thread creation.  It's not controversial that it'd be good to
have clone3() by able to explicitly specify a shadow stack, just if it
should be required.
