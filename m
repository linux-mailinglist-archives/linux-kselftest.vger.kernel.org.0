Ok, what do you think of the following proposal:

Add an uid_t field to the structure saved in the xattr. So this struct
contains now

faults: Number of crashes.
nsecs: Last crash timestamp as the number of nanoseconds in the
       International Atomic Time (TAI) reference.
period: Crash period's moving average.
flags: Statistics flags.
uid: User id not allowed to run the executable.

The logic would be the following:

1. faults, nsecs and period are updated in every crash and is a common inf=
o
   for all the users.
2. If the max number of faults is reached, it is "not allowed" to run the
   executable by any user. This condition blocks the file until root clear
   the xattr. No timeout.
3. When an attack is detected the uid of the user that is running the app
   is saved in the xattr and the executable is marked as "not allowed" to
   run by this user. The "not allowed" state has a timeout (more below).
4. When someone tries to run the executable, if his uid is different from
   the uid saved in the xattr, then the operation is "allowed".
5. When someone tries to run the executable, if his uid is equal to the
   uid saved in the xattr, then the operation is "not allowed". This user
   is banned for a timeout.
6. When someone tries to run the executable and the timeout has expired,
   the operation is "allowed" and the saved uid is removed.
7. If the executable crashes again when it is run by a user different from
   the one saved in the xattr (and the timeout has no expired), the file
   is marked as "not allowed" to run by any user. All users are banned for
   a timeout.

The timeout: I think there are two options here.

1. A fixed timeout set by a sysctl attribute.
2. A dynamic timeout calculated from the info stored in the xattr. The
   timeout would be the needed period to guarantee that when the app is
   run again and it crashes, the attack detection will not be triggered.
   To be more clear I expose the formulas:

   Mathematically the application crash period's EMA can be expressed as
   follows:

   period_ema[i] =3D period[i] * weight + period_ema[i - 1] * (1 - weight)

   If we isolate period:

   period[i] =3D (period_ema[i] - period_ema[i - 1] * (1 - weight)) / weig=
ht

   Where period_ema[i] is the "crash_period_threshold", period_ema[i - 1]
   is the last period ema saved in the xattr and period[i] is the dynamic
   timeout.

As a final point. Possibly there are more cases but the logic would be the
one explained. I think that it is not necessary to save the uid for every
user that crashes the app nor the crashes info for every user. If more
than one user crashes the application, something "bad" is happening. So,
all users are banned for a timeout. This way the info saved in the xattr
has a fixed size and we prevent an attacker from abusing this size.

I hope this proposal can be enough. What do you think?

John Wood.
