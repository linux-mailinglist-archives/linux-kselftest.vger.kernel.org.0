What I meant is your current code is fine, please don't remove the check.

Removing is_pte_marker() means you could potentially overwrite one swap
error entry with a marker only having uffd-wp bit set.  It can corrupt the
guest because swapin error is not recoverable and higher priority than wp.

Here when reaching unstable==true I think it means a rare race happened,
that a thp was _just_ installed.  You can try to read the comment over
pmd_trans_unstable() and pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad() to
understand what it wants to avoid.

Basically afaiu that's the ultimate guard if one wants to walk the pte
pgtable (that fact can change again if Hugh's series will land, but that's
another story).

As said, a patch will be posted (will have you copied) soon just for that,
so people can also comment and may help you / us know which is the right
way, probably not in a few hours (need to go very soon..), but shouldn't be
too long.  I just need to double check more users out of task_mmu.c when
we're at it.
