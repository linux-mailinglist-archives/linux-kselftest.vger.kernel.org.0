Why do you need those restrictions? I'd guess it is valid to request a
list of all pages with zero return_mask - this will return a compact
list of used ranges of the virtual address space.

This error case is (one of) the problems I propose avoiding. You also
need much more text to describe the requred/excluded flags
interactions and edge cases than saying that a flag must have a value
equal to corresponding bit in ~negated_flags to be matched by
requried/anyof masks.
