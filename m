Makes sense. Yes, this can be done.

These are page sizes. Start must be the starting address of the page. 
Length don't need to be the exact multiple of the page size. All the 
pages in the length are included just like mincore() syscall.

Yes, it if for counting pages. As the regions can have multiple pages, 
user cannot specify through the number of regions that how many pages 
does he need. Page size is used here as well like the start and len. 
This is optional argument as this is only needed to emulate the Windows 
syscall getWriteWatch.

Some non-dirty pages get marked as dirty because of the kernel's 
internal activity. The dirty bit of the pages is stored in the VMA flags 
and in the per page flags. If any of these two bits are set, the page is 
considered to be dirty. Suppose you have cleared the dirty bit of half 
of VMA which will be done by splitting the VMA and clearing dirty flag 
in the half VMA and the pages in it. Now kernel may decide to merge the 
VMAs again as dirty bit of VMAs isn't considered if the VMAs should be 
merged. So the half VMA becomes dirty again. This splitting/merging 
costs performance. The application receives a lot of pages which aren't 
dirty in reality but marked as dirty. Performance is lost again here.

This PAGEMAP_NO_REUSED_REGIONS flag is used to don't depend on the dirty 
flag in the VMA flags. It only depends on the individual page dirty bit. 
With doing this, the new memory regions which are just created, doesn't 
look like dirty when seen with the IOCTL, but look dirty when seen from 
pagemap. This seems okay as the user of this flag know the implication 
of using it.
