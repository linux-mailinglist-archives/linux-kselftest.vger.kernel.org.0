It seems there is a bug somewhere then. I'll take a look at v29.

Kernel does ignore them when reading, but what about returning a tagged
pointer? How that should work? In case of `walk_end` we can safely copy
the tag from `end` or `start` when we return exactly on of those. But what
about other addresses? When fed back as `start` any tag will work, so
the question is only what to do with pointers in the middle? We can clear
those of course - this should be mentioned in the doc - so userspace always
gets a predictable value (note: 'predictable' does not require treating
`start` and `end` the same way as addresses between them, just that what
happens is well defined). (I think making `walk_end` == `end` work
regardless of pointer tagging will make userspace happier, but I guess
doc will also make it workable. And I'm repeating myself. ;-)
