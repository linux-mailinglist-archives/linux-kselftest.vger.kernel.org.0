Is this the bi-directional eventfd benchmark?
https://github.com/intel/uintr-ipc-bench/blob/linux-rfc-v1/source/eventfd/e=
ventfd-bi.c

Two things stand out:

1. The server and client threads are racing on the same eventfd.
   Eventfds aren't bi-directional! The eventfd_wait() function has code
   to write the value back, which is a waste of CPU cycles and hinders
   progress. I've never seen eventfd used this way in real applications.
   Can you use two separate eventfds?

2. The fd is in blocking mode and the task may be descheduled, so we're
   measuring eventfd read/write latency plus scheduler/context-switch
   latency. A fairer comparison against user interrupts would be to busy
   wait on a non-blocking fd so the scheduler/context-switch latency is
   mostly avoided. After all, the uintrfd-bi.c benchmark does this in
   uintrfd_wait():

     // Keep spinning until the interrupt is received
     while (!uintr_received[token]);
