Good point, I had not realised that.

Unmapping is indeed more complex but I guess something similar needs to
happen for the thread stack to be reclaimed.

The thing I dislike about the kernel automatically mapping it is the
arbitrary fraction of RLIMIT_STACK size. glibc may use RLIMIT_STACK as a
hint for the thread stack size but is this the case for other libraries?
Some quick search (which I may have misinterpreted) shows that musl uses
128KB, bionic 1MB. So at this point the shadow stack size has no
relevance for the actual thread stack.

An alternative would be for the clone3() to provide an address _hint_
and size for GCS and it would still be the kernel doing the mmap (and
munmap on clearing). But at least the user has some control over the
placement of the GCS and its size (and maybe providing the address has
MAP_FIXED semantics).

Yes, this should work. Any invocation of clone() or clone3() without a
shadow stack would disable GCS. What about the reverse, should GCS be
enabled for a thread even if the clone3() caller has GCS disabled? I
guess we shouldn't since GCS enabling depends on the prctl() state set
previously.
