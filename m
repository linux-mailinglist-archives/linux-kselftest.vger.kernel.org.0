100% agree :)

I see your point, but I think that overloading memfd_create definitely gets
us into syscall multiplexing from day one and support for seals and huge
pages in the secretmem will not make it less of a multiplexer.

Sealing is anyway controlled via fcntl() and I don't think
MFD_ALLOW_SEALING makes much sense for the secretmem because it is there to
prevent rogue file sealing in tmpfs/hugetlbfs.

As for the huge pages, I'm not sure at all that supporting huge pages in
secretmem will involve hugetlbfs. And even if yes, adding SECRETMEM_HUGE
flag seems to me less confusing than saying "from kernel x.y you can use
MFD_CREATE | MFD_SECRET | MFD_HUGE" etc for all possible combinations.

It has been, but we have different thoughts about it ;-)
