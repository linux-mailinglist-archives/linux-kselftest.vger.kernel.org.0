Yes, dedicated flags are the way to go. I've used the old open() flags
here as examples as an echo of the O_CLOEXEC flag used in the comment.

I would have expect it to behave like most other file descriptor,
permission check done at opening time, which allow more privileged
process to open the file descriptor, then pass it to a less privileged
process, or change its own privileged with setuid() and such. Then the
less privileged process can act on behalf of the privileged process
through the file descriptor.

If the permission check is done at sending time, the scenario above
case cannot be implemented.

Sending a pidfd through SCM_RIGHT is only useful if the receiver
process is equally or more privileged than the sender then.

For isolation purpose, I would have expect to be able to give a right
to send a signal to a highly privileged process a specific less
privileged process though Unix socket.

But I can't come up with a specific use case. So I dunno.
