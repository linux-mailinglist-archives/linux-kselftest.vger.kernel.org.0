Yes, that would be better.  Or remove this cache mechanism entirely

and provide some helper functions of some sort to the limited

drivers that actually require such mechanism.

Any simplifications would be appreciated.

I sure don't understand what the code is trying to do.

Sure, whatever solves the issue.  All I wish to do is read

part of file into a buffer specified.
