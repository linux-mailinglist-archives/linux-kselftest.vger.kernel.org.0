Uacce isn't a driver (or wasn't last time I looked at it, when it had
a different name). It's more of a framework for standardized direct HW
access from userspace, and relies on I/O virtualization to keep DMA
secure/partitioned, etc. VK is more of a classic PCIe device, it'll
handle DMA to/from the host, etc.

This has more value on the device than on the host, as far as I've
seen it used (if you want to boot Linux on it and have things
exposed).

virtio isn't necessarily a match if all you really want is a character
stream for a console and don't need (or have performance requirements
beyond what virtio offers) other types of communication.

remoteproc is more about booting a tightly integrated device on an
embedded system. Also not a match here IMHO.

For a simple naive console/character stream, doing something on top of
hvc might be easier -- it already does polling for you, etc.

Of course, the intent is not to ever use it as a console for the host
here, so that aspect of hvc isn't useful. But it gives you a bunch of
other stuff for free with just getchar/putchar interfaces to
implement.
