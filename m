A few month (or even years) back, Pavel came up with an idea
to implement some kind of splice into a fixed buffer, if that
would be implemented I guess it would help me in Samba too.
My first usage was on the receive side (from the network).

But the other side might also be possible now we have RWF_DONTCACHE.
Instead of dropping the pages from the page cache, it might
be possible move them to fixed buffer instead.
It would mean the pages would be 'stable' when they are
no longer part of the pagecache.
But maybe my assumption for that is too naive...

Anyway that splice into a fixed buffer would great to have,
as the new IORING_OP_RECV_ZC, requires control over the
hardware queues of the nic and only allows a single process
to provide buffers for that receive queue (at least that's how
I understand it). And that's not possible for multiple process
(maybe not belonging to the same high level application and likely
non-root applications). So it would be great have splice into
fixed buffer as alternative to IORING_OP_SPLICE/IORING_OP_TEE,
as it would be more flexible to use in combination with
IORING_OP_SENDMSG_ZC as well as IORING_OP_WRITE[V]_FIXED with RWF_DONTCACHE.

I guess such a splice into fixed buffer linked to IORING_OP_SENDMSG_ZC
would be the way to simulate the sendfile2() in userspace?

Thanks!
