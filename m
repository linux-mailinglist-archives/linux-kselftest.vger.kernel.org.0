riscv (and others arches) have been able to do that because of "alternatives".
It's just that due to composable nature of riscv, alternatives are just spread
everywhere in the code and feels like riscv is doing something unique here.
Whenever there is a surgical placement of certain instructions in kernel, it
could be hidden behind alternatives and be patched in runtime.

However situations where instructions are emitted as part of codegen, there is
no hiding. Either it works or it doesn't. If we have auto vectorization enabled
in usermode, such a binary won't run on hardware which doesn't implement vector.

In case of shadow stack, it similar situation. If enabled compiler decides to
insert sspush and sspopchk. They necessarily won't be prologue or epilogue but
somewhere in function body as deemed fit by compiler, thus increasing the
complexity of runtime patching.

More so, here are wishing for kernel to do this patching for usermode vDSO when
there is no guarantee of such of rest of usermode (which if was compiled with
shadow stack would have faulted before vDSO's sspush/sspopchk if ran on
pre-zimop hardware)

And that's the reason currently default is "No" for cfi config in kernel.
Hope is whenever we have hardware, we can start lighting up and take decision
how to proceed. I keep reiterting, door isn't closed yet but we gotta approach
the door.

>platform other than qemu to test this code. 

I have tested this with qemu in following configurations

qemu implements cfi extensions:
Kernel with cfi enable is able to host userspace with and without cfi compiled.
Kernel with cfi enable is able to host userspace with cfi but disabled (default
to zimop)
Kernel without cfi enable is able to host userspace with cfi (default to zimop)
and without cfi.

qemu doesn't implement cfi extension:
- Kernel without cfi enable is able to host userspace without cfi compiled in.
- Kernel without cfi enable hosting userspace with cfi compiled in faults in
   libc/ld on first sspush.
- Kernel with cfi enable trying to host userspace with cfi faults in libc/ld on
   first sspush.
- Kernel with cfi enable trying to host userspace without cfi faults in vDSO on
   first sspush.

Last case is the only breaking case, rest all compatibilities stories work.
In order to solve this last compatiblity story, I am fearful that we might be
adding un-necessary complexity in kernel which isn't desired because rest of
the userspace won't be signing up for that complexity of patching and making
it work with single binary.

I wished that shadow stack instructions came out of HINT space. But it is
what it is. Perhaps distro should give this feedback to RVI. But here we
are.

zimop is backward compatible only RVA23 onwards. That's why it's important
for distro to make a decision on this. Once they compile for RVA23 profile,
it assumed a clean break from previous hardware. Future extensions will also
take encodings out of zimop and thus I believe its better to take that decision
now with first user of zimop.

Again, Why kernel should be doing this when rest of the userspace isn't
patchable on pre-zimop hardware (thats the only scenario patching is needed)?

Are distro's distributing different binary for with autovec and without autovec
for different kind of riscv hardware?

Giving example of Fedora 43, once it is compiled in with cfi enabling, kernel is
also compiled in with the feature. Its not like there is going to "Fedora
43_rv64gc" release. If there is going to be a "Fedora 43_rv64gc" release, it'll
be much easier to no select CFI for that release's kernel compile rather than
kernel doing patching in runtime (rest of userspace is not doing any patching)
