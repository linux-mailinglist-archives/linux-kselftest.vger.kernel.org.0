OK, so not sharing, just happening to be adjacent.

I was thinking from a standpoint of allocating them as part of the
same range as the main stack, just with different protections, where
that would never happen; you'd always have intervening non-shadowstack
pages. But when they're kernel-allocated, yes, they need their own
guard pages.

I don't think it's safe to have automatic conversions back and forth,
only for normal accesses to convert shadowstack to normal memory (in
which case, any subsequent attempt to operate on it as shadow stack
indicates a critical bug and should be trapped to terminate the
process).

Where can I read more about this? Some searches I tried didn't turn up
much useful information.

Well I'm not sure. That's what we're trying to figure out. But I don't
think modifying it is a hard requirement, since it can be modified
from userspace if needed as long as signals are masked.

I didn't follow this whole mess, but from our side (musl) it does not
seem relevant. There are no legacy binaries wrongly marked because we
have never supported shadow stacks so far.

This is the kernel's problem if that's happening. It should be
trapping these and returning immediately like a NOP if shadow stack
has been disabled, not generating SIGILL.

One thing to note here is that, to enable this, we're going to need
some way to detect "new enough kernel that shadow stack semantics are
all right". If there are kernels that have shadow stack support but
with problems that make it unsafe to use (this sounds like the case),
we can't turn it on without a way to avoid trying to use it on those.
