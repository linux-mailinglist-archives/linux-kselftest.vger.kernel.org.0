I'll send a mail during the next weeks to gather current restrictions to 
document them (and include my brain dump). We might see more excessive 
use of ZONE_MOVABLE in the future and as history told us, of CMA as 
well. We really should start documenting/caring.

@Mike, it would be sufficient for me if one of your patches at least 
mention the situation in the description like

"Please note that secretmem currently behaves much more like long-term 
GUP instead of mlocked memory; secretmem is unmovable memory directly 
consumed/controlled by user space. secretmem cannot be placed onto 
ZONE_MOVABLE/CMA.

As long as there is no excessive use of secretmem (e.g., maximum of 16 
MiB for selected processes) in combination with ZONE_MOVABLE/CMA, this 
is barely a real issue. However, it is something to keep in mind when a 
significant amount of system RAM might be used for secretmem. In the 
future, we might support migration of secretmem and make it look much 
more like mlocked memory instead."

Just a suggestion.
