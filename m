It was out on LKML for 2+ weeks before I've pulled it in. As it mostly
touches hyperv bits I felt comfortable to give it time in -next (but not
actually to try and merge it until it gets a few acks).

Appologies about this. I ended up with way more travel than I would have
liked (writing this from an airport). I've reset our hyperv-next branch
to remove these 3 commits until we figure this out.

I'm sorry for this, you were supposed to be Cc'ed on these patches and I
see that you were not.

Okay, thank you. We'll rebase and resend.
