Let's just make it a feature flag,

  UFFD_FEATURE_WP_ASYNC

Firstly, please consider not touching the existing code/indent as much as
what this patch did.  Hopefully we can keep the major part of sync uffd be
there with its git log, it also helps reviewing your code.  You can add the
async block before that, handle the fault and return just earlier.

And, I think this is a bit too late because we're going to return with
VM_FAULT_RETRY here, while maybe we don't need to retry at all here because
we're going to resolve the page fault immediately.

I assume you added this because you wanted userfaultfd_ctx_get() to make
sure the uffd context will not go away from under us, but it's not needed
if we're still holding the mmap read lock.  I'd expect for async mode we
don't really need to release it at all.

> +		// Resolve page fault of this page

Please use "/* ... */" as that's the common pattern of commenting in the
Linux kernel, at least what I see in mm/.

This is weird - if we want async uffd-wp, let's consider huge page from the
1st day.

VM_HUGEPAGE is only a hint.  It doesn't mean this page is always a huge
page.  For anon, we can have thp wr-protected as a whole, not happening for
!anon because we'll split already.

For anon, if a write happens to a thp being uffd-wp-ed, we'll keep that pmd
wr-protected and report the uffd message.  The pmd split happens when the
user invokes UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT on the small page.  I think it'll stop
working for async uffd-wp because we're going to resolve the page faults
right away.

So for async uffd-wp (note: this will be different from hugetlb), you may
want to consider having a pre-requisite patch to change wp_huge_pmd()
behavior: rather than calling handle_userfault(), IIUC you can also just
fallback to the split path right below (__split_huge_pmd) so the thp will
split now even before the uffd message is generated.

I think it should be transparent to the user and it'll start working for
you with async uffd-wp here, because it means when reaching
handle_userfault, it should not be possible to have thp at all since they
should have all split up.

This is an overkill - we're pretty sure it's a single page, no need to call
a range function here.

Please no..  ctx attributes shouldn't be easily changed by a single ioctl.

I suggest we have a new feature bit as I mentioned above (say,
UFFD_FEATURE_WP_ASYNC), set it once with UFFDIO_API and it should apply to
the whole lifecycle of this uffd handle.  That flag should (something I can
quickly think of):

  - Have effect only if the uffd will be registered with WP mode (of
    course) or ignored in any other modes,

  - Should fail any attempts of UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT with wp=false on this
    uffd handle because with async faults no page fault resolution needed
    from userspace,

  - Should apply to any region registered with this uffd ctx, so it's
    exclusively used with sync uffd-wp mode.

Then when the app wants to wr-protect in async mode, it simply goes ahead
with UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT(wp=true), it'll happen exactly the same as when it
was sync mode.  It's only the pf handling procedure that's different (along
with how the fault is reported - rather than as a message but it'll be
consolidated into the soft-dirty bit).
