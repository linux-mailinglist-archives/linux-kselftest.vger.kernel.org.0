OK, then it isn't one common usage, in which kobject covers the release
of the external object. What is the exact kobject in livepatching?

But kobject_del() won't release the kobject, you shouldn't need the lock
to delete kobject first. After the kobject is deleted, no any show() and
store() any more, isn't such sync[1] you expected?
