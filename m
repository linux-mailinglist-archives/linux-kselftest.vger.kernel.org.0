The kernel's linker will ensure this doesn't happen by default, ie
__init data called from non __init code gets a complaint at linker
time today.

*Iff* you are sure the code is proper, you *whitelist* it by adding the
__ref tag to it.

I'd split out tests in two different arrays, one with __init or
__initdata  one without. Likewise two dispatches, one for init and
one for non-init data.

The Linux kernel table / section ranges code helps aggregate data into
ELF sections in a generic way, that is, hacks we have been doing over
years into a generic way.

So it would be easier to read and implement. For instance see how in
this commit the intent/goal of kprobe blacklists is a bit easier to
read:

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/mcgrof/linux-next.git/commit/?h=20170620-linker-tables-v8&id=b2662efa7c6a3c436961c07fa3082e8640f0e352

In particular DEFINE_LINKTABLE_INIT_DATA() use. I think Youd' want to
use DEFINE_LINKTABLE_INIT_DATA() for code which you want to use to
dispatch on init and and a DEFINE_LINKTABLE_DATA() for non-init code.

If a dynamic dispatcher is used you'd opt out of the using for instance
linktable_for_each() and instead use the data structure defined for
however you want to disaptch your run time.
