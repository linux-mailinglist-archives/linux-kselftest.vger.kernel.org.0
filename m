The arm64 Guarded Control Stack (GCS) feature provides support for
hardware protected stacks of return addresses, intended to provide
hardening against return oriented programming (ROP) attacks and to make
it easier to gather call stacks for applications such as profiling.

When GCS is active a secondary stack called the Guarded Control Stack is
maintained, protected with a memory attribute which means that it can
only be written with specific GCS operations.  The current GCS pointer
can not be directly written to by userspace.  When a BL is executed the
value stored in LR is also pushed onto the GCS, and when a RET is
executed the top of the GCS is popped and compared to LR with a fault
being raised if the values do not match.  GCS operations may only be
performed on GCS pages, a data abort is generated if they are not.

The combination of hardware enforcement and lack of extra instructions
in the function entry and exit paths should result in something which
has less overhead and is more difficult to attack than a purely software
implementation like clang's shadow stacks.

This series implements support for use of GCS by userspace, along with
support for use of GCS within KVM guests.  It does not enable use of GCS
by either EL1 or EL2, this will be implemented separately.  Executables
are started without GCS and must use a prctl() to enable it, it is
expected that this will be done very early in application execution by
the dynamic linker or other startup code.  For dynamic linking this will
be done by checking that everything in the executable is marked as GCS
compatible.

x86 has an equivalent feature called shadow stacks, this series depends
on the x86 patches for generic memory management support for the new
guarded/shadow stack page type and shares APIs as much as possible.  As
there has been extensive discussion with the wider community around the
ABI for shadow stacks I have as far as practical kept implementation
decisions close to those for x86, anticipating that review would lead to
similar conclusions in the absence of strong reasoning for divergence.

The main divergence I am concious of is that x86 allows shadow stack to
be enabled and disabled repeatedly, freeing the shadow stack for the
thread whenever disabled, while this implementation keeps the GCS
allocated after disable but refuses to reenable it.  This is to avoid
races with things actively walking the GCS during a disable, we do
anticipate that some systems will wish to disable GCS at runtime but are
not aware of any demand for subsequently reenabling it.

x86 uses an arch_prctl() to manage enable and disable, since only x86
and S/390 use arch_prctl() a generic prctl() was proposed[1] as part of a
patch set for the equivalent RISC-V Zicfiss feature which I initially
adopted fairly directly but following review feedback has been revised
quite a bit.

We currently maintain the x86 pattern of implicitly allocating a shadow
stack for threads started with shadow stack enabled, there has been some
discussion of removing this support and requiring the use of clone3()
with explicit allocation of shadow stacks instead.  I have no strong
feelings either way, implicit allocation is not really consistent with
anything else we do and creates the potential for errors around thread
exit but on the other hand it is existing ABI on x86 and minimises the
changes needed in userspace code.

There is an open issue with support for CRIU, on x86 this required the
ability to set the GCS mode via ptrace.  This series supports
configuring mode bits other than enable/disable via ptrace but it needs
to be confirmed if this is sufficient.

The series depends on support for shadow stacks in clone3(), that series
includes the addition of ARCH_HAS_USER_SHADOW_STACK.

It also depends on the addition of more waitpid() flags to nolibc:

Changes in v7:
- Rebase onto v6.7-rc2 via the clone3() patch series.
- Change the token used to cap the stack during signal handling to be
  compatible with GCSPOPM.
- Fix flags for new page types.
- Fold in support for clone3().
- Replace copy_to_user_gcs() with put_user_gcs().
- Link to v6: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20231009-arm64-gcs-v6-0-78e55deaa4dd@kernel.org

Changes in v6:
- Rebase onto v6.6-rc3.
- Add some more gcsb_dsync() barriers following spec clarifications.
- Due to ongoing discussion around clone()/clone3() I've not updated
  anything there, the behaviour is the same as on previous versions.
- Link to v5: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20230822-arm64-gcs-v5-0-9ef181dd6324@kernel.org

Changes in v5:
- Don't map any permissions for user GCSs, we always use EL0 accessors
  or use a separate mapping of the page.
- Reduce the standard size of the GCS to RLIMIT_STACK/2.
- Enforce a PAGE_SIZE alignment requirement on map_shadow_stack().
- Clarifications and fixes to documentation.
- More tests.
- Link to v4: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20230807-arm64-gcs-v4-0-68cfa37f9069@kernel.org

Changes in v4:
- Implement flags for map_shadow_stack() allowing the cap and end of
  stack marker to be enabled independently or not at all.
- Relax size and alignment requirements for map_shadow_stack().
- Add more blurb explaining the advantages of hardware enforcement.
- Link to v3: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20230731-arm64-gcs-v3-0-cddf9f980d98@kernel.org

Changes in v3:
- Rebase onto v6.5-rc4.
- Add a GCS barrier on context switch.
- Add a GCS stress test.
- Link to v2: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20230724-arm64-gcs-v2-0-dc2c1d44c2eb@kernel.org

Changes in v2:
- Rebase onto v6.5-rc3.
- Rework prctl() interface to allow each bit to be locked independently.
- map_shadow_stack() now places the cap token based on the size
  requested by the caller not the actual space allocated.
- Mode changes other than enable via ptrace are now supported.
- Expand test coverage.
- Various smaller fixes and adjustments.
- Link to v1: https://lore.kernel.org/r/20230716-arm64-gcs-v1-0-bf567f93bba6@kernel.org
