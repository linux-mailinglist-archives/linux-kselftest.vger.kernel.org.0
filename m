Not exactly, I was wondering if adding a more abstract structure specificly
for page pool makes any sense, and each mem type can add its own specific
fields, net stack only see and handle the common fields so that it does not
care about specific mem type, and each provider only see the and handle the
specific fields belonging to it most of the time.

Ideally something like beleow:

struct netmem {
	/* common fields */
	refcount_t refcount;
	struct page_pool *pp;
	......

	union {
		struct devmem{
			struct dmabuf_genpool_chunk_owner *owner;
		};

		struct other_mem{
			...
			...
		};
	};
};

But untill we completely decouple the 'struct page' from the net stack,
the above seems undoable in the near term.
But we might be able to do something as folio is doing now, mm subsystem
is still seeing 'struct folio/page', but other subsystem like slab is using
'struct slab', and there is still some common fields shared between
'struct folio' and 'struct slab'.

As the netmem patchset, is devmem able to reuse the below 'struct netmem'
and rename it to 'struct page_pool_iov'? So that 'struct page' for normal
memory and 'struct page_pool_iov' for devmem share the common fields used
by page pool and net stack? And we might be able to reuse the 'flags',
'_pp_mapping_pad' and '_mapcount' for specific mem provider, which is enough
for the devmem only requiring a single pointer to point to it's
owner?

+struct netmem {
+	unsigned long flags;
+	unsigned long pp_magic;
+	struct page_pool *pp;
+	/* private: no need to document this padding */
+	unsigned long _pp_mapping_pad;	/* aliases with folio->mapping */

If we do that, it seems we might be able to allow net stack and page pool to see
the metadata for devmem chunk as 'struct page', and may be able to aovid most of
the 'if' checking in net stack and page pool?
