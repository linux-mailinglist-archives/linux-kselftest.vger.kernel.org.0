Sorry for reiterating, I have been gone for a while, so maybe I lost a
bit of context.

In that case, should we add a comment in the Kconfig that says "it
breaks userspace on older-than RVA23 platforms"?

Perhaps a very ugly way to make RVA23-compiled kernel compatible with
pre-RVA23 platforms is to decode maybe-ops in the illegal exception
handler...

Btw, I don't think kenrel-level shadow stack should be an argument
here, as kernel-level APIs are more flexible by nature.

Thanks,
Andy
