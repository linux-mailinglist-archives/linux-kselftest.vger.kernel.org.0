Migration support is in pipeline. It is part of TDX 1.5 [1]. And swapping
theoretically possible, but I'm not aware of any plans as of now.

The design allows for extension to hugetlbfs if needed. Combination of
MFD_INACCESSIBLE | MFD_HUGETLB should route this way. There should be zero
implications for shmem. It is going to be separate struct memfile_backing_store.

I'm not sure secretmem is a fit here as we want to extend MFD_INACCESSIBLE
to be movable if platform supports it and secretmem is not migratable by
design (without direct mapping fragmentations).

I guess shim layer on top of shmem *can* work. I don't see immediately why
it would not. But I'm not sure it is right direction. We risk creating yet
another parallel VM with own rules/locking/accounting that opaque to
core-mm.

Note that on machines that run TDX guests such memory would likely be the
bulk of memory use. Treating it as a fringe case may bite us one day.
