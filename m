I though about differentiating user xattr, atime/mtime, DAC 
(chown/chmod, posix ACLs), and other xattr, but it would be too complex 
to get a consistent approach because of indirect consequences (e.g. 
controlling umask, setegid, settimeofday…). Let's make it simple for now.

Here is an update on my previous proposal:

LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_METADATA to read any file/dir metadata (i.e. 
inode attr and xattr). In practice, for most use cases, this access 
right should be granted whenever LANDLOCK_ACCESS_READ_DIR is allowed.

LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE_METADATA to *explicitly* write any inode attr 
or xattr (i.e. chmod, chown, utime, and all xattr). It should be noted 
that file modification time and access time should always be updated 
according to the file operation (e.g. write, truncate) even when this 
access is not explicitly allowed (according to vfs_utimes(), 
ATTR_TIMES_SET and ATTR_TOUCH should enable to differentiate from 
implicit time changes).

I think this can be solved thanks to the ovl_path_real() helper.
