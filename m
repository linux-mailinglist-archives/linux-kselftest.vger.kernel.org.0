Thank you for understanding what I've been trying to convey. We are going
to translate Windows syscall to this new ioctl. So it is very difficult to
find out the exact use cases as application must be using this syscall in
several different ways. There is one thing for sure is that we want to get
best performance possible which we are getting by adding WP-only. I'll add
it and send v16. I think that we are almost there.
