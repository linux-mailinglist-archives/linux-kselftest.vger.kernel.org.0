Cool! This seems like it'd be very handy to make other types of kernel
data "read-only at rest" (as was long ago proposed via X86_CR0_WP[1],
which only provided to protection levels, not 15). For example, I think
at least a few other kinds of areas stand out to me that are in need
of PKS markings (i.e. only things that actually manipulate these areas
should gain temporary PK access):
- Page Tables themselves
- Identity mapping
- The "read-only at rest" stuff, though it'll need special plumbing to
  make it work with the slab allocator, etc (more like the later "static
  allocation" work[2]).
