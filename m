Ummm.  Not to speak for Frank, but he's representing the device tree
layer, which I'd argue sits exactly at the intersection of testing device d=
rivers
AND lots of complex code which is hardware independent.  So maybe his

Handling these types of things that are not "really that hard to do" is
exactly what meta-frameworks like KCI, Fuego, and LKFT are for.
For a core developer in a sub-system, having them learn a particular
specialized framework is OK.  However, for someone doing integration
testing of the kernel (not a core developer
in a particular subsystem), having lots of different frameworks turns
into death by a thousand cuts.  But we're working to fix that.
(Which reminds me that I have an outstanding action item to add an xfstest
test definition to Fuego. :-) )

This seems to me to be exactly backwards.  You scale your contributors
by making it easier for them, which means adopting something already
well-know or established - not by being different.

I understand your vise grip metaphor, and agree with you.  In my opinion
kselftest and kunit are optimized for different things, and are different t=
ools
in the Linux kernel testing toolbox.  But if you start having too many tool=
s, or
the tools are too specialized, there are less people familiar with them and
ready to use them to help contribute.

I had one thing I wanted to ask about here.  You said previously that
you plan to use KUnit to test a complicated but hardware independent
part of the filesystem code.  If you test only via UML, will that give you
coverage for non-x86 platforms? More specifically, will you get coverage
for 32-bit, for big-endian as well as little-endian, for weird architecture=
s?
It seems like the software for these complicated sections of code is
subject to regressions due to toolchain issues as much as from coding error=
s.
That's why I was initially turned off when I  heard that KUnit only planned
to support UML and not cross-compilation.

I'm not sure what the status is of UML for all the weird embedded processor=
s
that get only cross-compiled and not natively-compiled, but there are multi=
ple
reasons why UML is less commonly used in the embedded space.

This might solve my cross-compile needs, so that's good.

Had to look up "Procrustean Bed" - great phrase.  :-)

I'm not of the opinion that there must only be one test framework
in the kernel. But we should avoid unnecessary multiplication. Every
person is going to have a different idea for where the line of necessity
is drawn.  My own opinion is that what KUnit is adding is different enough
from kselftest, that it's a valuable addition. =20
