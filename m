In my view, adding this calculation to `flag` would make the `flag double
meaning. 1) user flags 2) wp flag is turn on or off
Okay, I've added the flag and removed this function call from
frpagemap_scan_test_walk().

We only need to split if doing GET+WP or WP only. In case of WP op, I need
to check if we have less than HPAGE_SIZE/PAGE_SIZE pages and only then
split. So moving this  if condition would not be beneficial.

Definately, but I'll have to add a extra variable. I'll add it as you have
asked.

Okay. I'll update.

Returning error in case of only WP means partial hugetlb is hit. User
should expect the partial wp on the memory area already.

If we really want to return number of pages cleared, possible option of
return value:
* Return 0 means whole region is wp-ed
* Return number of pages wp-ed if some error occurred (we need to handle
this only for hugetlb) OR return -1 * number of pages wp-ed?

An another uniform way can be to sum all wp-ed pages every time and return
them * -. -1 is needed to let the know user that wp operation got halted
mid way.

I'll update as you are saying. After updating, we cannot abort this outer
loop if length is 0 as the last element is present in cur.

So we do have colors in variable names. :) I'll update.
