OK, so we only get a 0 here if the gcs_{base,size} has not be
initialised. Looks fine.

The GCS memory writes in the parent must indeed be visible in the child
that could start on a different CPU. So, in principle, we need some form
of ordering similar to the context switch. However, in case of classic
fork(), the child won't be started until the PTEs have been made
read-only and a TLBI issued. This would ensure the completion of any GCS
memory accesses in the parent (at least that's my reading of the Arm
ARM).

If we have normal thread creation without CoW, is the parent writing
anything to the stack that the new thread needs to observe? The
map_shadow_stack() call will cause a GCSSTTR and this wouldn't be
ordered with subsequent memory writes. But we already have a GCSB DSYNC
in map_shadow_stack() after put_user_gcs().

My conclusion is that we don't need this barrier.

The half size looks a lot more arbitrary to me than picking the same
size as the stack. So I'd go with RLIMIT_STACK.

I thought for the clone3() x86 code we'll need the remote vma, so we
have to use the get_user_page_vma_remote() API anyway.

Correct but GUP goes through the kernel mapping, not the user one. So
get_user_page_vma_remote() returns a page and you just do a classic
cmpxchg() at page_address() (plus some offset).
