Thanks for the patchset. Being able to specify what pid namespace the
procfs instance is supposed to belong to is super useful and will make
things easier for userspace for sure.

The code you added contains a minor wrinkle that I disliked which I've
changed and you tell me if you can live with this restriction or not.

The way you've implemented it specifying a pid namespace that the caller
holds privilege over would silently also override the user namespace the
filesystem is supposed to belong to.

Specifically, you did something like:

        put_pid_ns(ctx->pid_ns);
        ctx->pid_ns = get_pid_ns(target);
        put_user_ns(fc->user_ns);
        fc->user_ns = get_user_ns(ctx->pid_ns->user_ns);

This silently overrides the user namespace recorded at fsopen() time. I
think that's too subtle and we should just not allow that at all for
now.

Instead I've changed this to:

        if (fc->user_ns != target->user_ns)
                return invalfc(fc, "owning user namespace of pid namespace doesn't match procfs user namespace");

        put_pid_ns(ctx->pid_ns);
        ctx->pid_ns = get_pid_ns(target);

so we just refuse different owernship.

I've also dropped the procfs ioctl because I'm not sure how much value
it will actually add given that you can do this via /proc/1/ns/pid.

If that is something that libpathrs despearately needs I would like to
do it as a separate patch anyways.

Thanks for the excellent cover letter. This was a pleasure merging!
