Well, I have some small isolated examples that I think would probably
work no matter what, so we can get some usage outside of ext4. Also,
if we want to limit the number of tests, then we don't expect to get
much usage outside of ext4 before v5.5 anyway. I just figure, it's
better to make it work for one person than no one, right?

In any case, I admit it is not a great idea. I just thought it had
some interesting advantages over going in through linux-kselftest that
were worth exploring.

So we are going to encourage maintainers to allow tests in their tree
based on KUnit on the assumption that KUnit will get merged before
there changes? That sounds like a huge burden, not just on us, but on
other maintainers and users.

I think if we are going to allow tests before KUnit is merged, we
should have the tests come in through the same tree as KUnit.

Well it is different if the maintainer wants to send the test in
through their tree, right? Otherwise, it won't matter what the state
of linux-next is and it won't matter when linux-kselftest gets merged.
Or am I not understanding you?
