No, this cannot be done. vec_buf_index represents overall index in vec_buf
which is a user buffer. We cannot access it conveniently. This is why I'd
added cur_buf in the fisrt place.

There are 3 kinds of return values here:
* PM_SCAN_FOUND_MAX_PAGES (1) ---> max_pages have been found. Abort the
page walk from next entry
* 0 ---> continue the page walk
* -ENOMEM --> Abort the page walk from current entry, user buffer is full
which is not error, but only a stop signal. This -ENOMEM is just
differentiater from (1). This -ENOMEM is for internal use and isn't
returned to user.

I think it would be better to use following in place of -ENOMEM:
#define PM_SCAN_BUFFER_FULL	(-256)

I'll update.

I didn't get it. As the max_pages is optional, its validity needs to be
checked first.

Sure, I'll update.

This is intended to indicate that if userfaultfd is needed. If
PAGE_IS_WRITTEN is mentioned in any of mask, we need to check if
userfaultfd has been initialized for this memory. I'll rename to
PM_SCAN_REQUIRE_UFFD.

I know it makes flags checking easier if we remove PM_SCAN_OP_GET. But
it'll created complications later if more OPs are added to the IOCTL. Lets
not remove it.

Some history:
I'd PM_SCAN_OP_GET. Then someone asked me to remove it. Then someone asked
me to add it back.

I'd access_ok() for vec. But I removed it after discussion with you. Now I
only check that vec shouldn't be NULL:

On the second look, I think the code already checks that while doing
copy_to_user(), so this check is redundant and can be removed.

My intention is that no other flag than PAGE_IS_WRITTEN must be specified
in all masks if WP op is specified.

If exluded_mask = PAGE_IS_WRITTEN,
* the page would be rejected if page is written. No need to WP these.
* Only those pages would be allowed which aren't written. Then would also
not write protected.

So write protect operation wouldn't happen logically. It is on user for not
comprehending the combined meaning of WP op and excluded mask.

Do you agree or do you want me to reject WP op if excluded = PAGE_IS_WRITTEN?

I'll add flags==0 condition.

The deification of this struct says, "with bitmap flags". Bitmap was a
different name. I'll update it to flags.

As start and len already communicate the meaning. We are making things more

I'm really sad to hear this. I've been working on making this series from
so many revisions. I was hopping that it would make complete sense to
reviewers and later to users.

What do you think is missing which is restricting these patches getting
accepted to upstream?

> should affect GET, WP and WP+GET. Should they limit the pages walked

The address range needs to be walked until max pages pages are found, user
buffer is full or whole range is walked. If the page will be added to user
buffer or not depends on the selection criteria (*masks). There is no
difference in case of walk for GET, WP and GET+WP. Only that WP doesn't
take any user buffer and just WPs the whole region.
