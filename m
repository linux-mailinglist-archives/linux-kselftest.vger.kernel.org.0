Thanks for the praise! That means a lot coming from you!

I really cannot disagree that I could use more documentation. You can
pretty much always use more documentation. Nevertheless, is there a
particular part of the documentation that you think it lacking?

It sounds like there was a pretty long discussion here about, a number
of different things.

Do you want a better description of what unit testing is and how KUnit
helps make it possible?

Do you want more of an explanation distinguishing KUnit from kselftest?
How so?

Do you just want better documentation on how to test the kernel? What
tools we have at our disposal and when to use what tools?

Thanks!
