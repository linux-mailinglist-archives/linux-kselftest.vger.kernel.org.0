Oh, so it simply meant code without memory leaks :-).

That's, unfortunately, what I needed to do even if it resulted in less 
clean code when I, in a later patch that is not part of this series, 
added a function the setup the default parameters into user parameters 
struct. main() will now pass that span_str for it to do "symmetrical" 
free inside main().

you make it sound easier than the reality is. There's no singular point 
that is "exit of main()". It has way too many exit paths because of how 
selftests framework works. It doesn't give you back control when you ask 
it to exit the tests.

You'll see how complicated this gets once we get to the user parameters 
structure patch but I'll use asprintf()+free() for now ;-). We can revisit 
this discussion if you feel like it when we get to that patch.

...And to think this all is because C cannot easily make known constant 
int -> string conversion w/o some runtime code.

Of course.
