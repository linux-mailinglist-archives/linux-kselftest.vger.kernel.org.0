Yeah. Luis suggested just not supporting the IRQ context until later.
See my later comment.

It says KERN_CONT is not SMP safe, and it isn't supposed to contain
newlines, so it doesn't sound like it does any buffering for you. I
looked at it a while ago and those comments agreed with my
understanding of the code, but I could be wrong.

> Can printk be called once with whatever is in the struct?

Unfortunately, no. That is part of what I was trying to illustrate
with this patch. Most of the messages are deterministic, but
hardcoding all the possible message types would lead to a massive
number of hard coded strings. However, even this would break down for
the mocking formatters. All the different ways a function can be
called are just too complex to encode into a finite set of hard coded
fmt strings.

Ehhh...I wouldn't mind providing such an interface, but I would really
like to be able to provide the results without having to depend on a
userland doing something to get test results. That has always been a
pretty important goal for me.

Like you said, I think it is a bit premature to go that far.

In anycase, I don't see a way to get rid of string_stream, without
significantly sacrificing usability.

Yep, I actually presented the first pieces of that in the RFC v1 that
I linked to you earlier in this discussion. I have a more fleshed out
example here:

https://kunit.googlesource.com/linux/+/e10484ad2f9fc7926412ec84739fe105981b4771/drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-aspeed-test.c

I actually already have some people at Google playing around with it.
So yeah, not far off at all! However, in these cases we are not
actually running in the IRQ context (despite the fact that we are
testing IRQ code) because we provide a fake IRQ chip, or some other
fake mechanism that triggers the IRQ. Still, I could see someone
wanting to do it in a non-fake-IRQ context.

Luis' suggestion was just to hold off on the IRQ safe stuff at the
outset, since that is going to require a lot more effort to review. I
know that's kind of the future coding argument again, but maybe the
answer will be to just restrict what features an IRQ user has access
to (maybe just really simple expectations, for example). I mean, we
will probably have to restrict what they are allowed to use anyway.

Luis, do you have any ideas?

Cheers
