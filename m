6 bytes on interface structure will make almost no difference.
There is no reason to save more than 16 bits anywhere else.
You could error values with high bits set.

The padding had to be after the u16 field.

Only if userspace is guaranteed to memset the entire structure
before making the call - rather than just fill in all the fields it knows about.
If it doesn't use memset() then recompiling old code with new headers
will pass garbage to the kernel.
copy_struct_from_user() cannot solve that problem.
You'll never be able to guarantee that all code actually clears the
entire structure - so at some point extending it will break recompilations
of old code - annoying.
