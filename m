It can for VMs, but not really for the user space secret memory use
cases ... the in-kernel mitigations already present are much more
effective.

/dev/mem uses the direct map for the copy at least for read/write, so
it gets a fault in the same way root trying to use ptrace does.  I
think we've protected mmap, but Mike would know that better than I.

Unless there's a corner case I haven't thought of, I don't think it
adds much.  However, doing a full lockdown on a public system where
users want to use secret memory is best practice I think (except I
think you want it to be the full secure boot lockdown to close all the
root holes).

Anything that can leave physical memory intact but boot to a kernel
where the missing direct map entry is restored could theoretically
extract the secret.  However, it's not exactly going to be a stealthy
extraction ...

I think we could handle it by marking the region, yes, and a zero on
shutdown might be useful ... it would prevent all warm reboot type
attacks.
