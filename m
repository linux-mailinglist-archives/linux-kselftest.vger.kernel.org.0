Right, I'll add this to the documentation (aligned with the new
implementation).

I used copy_struct_from_user() before v21, but Arnd wasn't a fan of
having type and size arguments, so we simplified the UAPI in the v21 by
removing the size argument. The type argument is enough to extend the
structure, but indeed, we lose the forward compatibility. Relying on one
syscall per rule type seems too much, though.

Arnd, what do you think?

If layers are correctly used, a few I guess.

I agree, I'll not implement such optimization for now.
