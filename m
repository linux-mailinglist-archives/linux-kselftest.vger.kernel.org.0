I thought Greg originally meant that that is how it could be done when
he first commented on this patch, so I was agreeing and elaborating.
Nevertheless, it seems you and Greg are now in agreement on this
point, so I won't argue it further.

Sorry, that was in reference to your concern about getting an email in
a different format than what the tool that you use generates. It
wasn't a statement about what I was or wasn't going to do in regards
to supporting a standard format.

My mistake, I thought that was a concern of yours.

In any case, it sounds like you and Greg are in agreement on the core
libraries generating the output in TAP13, so I won't argue that point
further.

## Analysis of using TAP13

One of my earlier concerns was that TAP13 is a bit over constrained
for what I would like to output from the KUnit core. It only allows
data to be output as either:
 - test number
 - ok/not ok with single line description
 - directive
 - diagnostics
 - YAML block

The test number must become before a set of ok/not ok lines, and does
not contain any additional information. One annoying thing about this
is it doesn't provide any kind of nesting or grouping.

There is one ok/not ok line per test and it may have a short
description of the test immediately after 'ok' or 'not ok'; this is
problematic because it wants the first thing you say about a test to
be after you know whether it passes or not.

Directives are just a way to specify skipped tests and TODOs.

Diagnostics seem useful, it looks like you can put whatever
information in them and print them out at anytime. It looks like a lot
of kselftests emit a lot of data this way.

The YAML block seems to be the way that they prefer users to emit data
beyond number of tests run and whether a test passed or failed. I
could express most things I want to express in terms of YAML, but it
is not the nicest format for displaying a lot of data like
expectations, missed function calls, and other things which have a
natural concise representation. Nevertheless, YAML readability is
mostly a problem who won't be using the wrapper scripts. My biggest
problem with the YAML block is that you can only have one, and TAP
specifies that it must come after the corresponding ok/not ok line,
which again has the issue that you have to hold on to a lot of
diagnostic data longer than you ideally would. Another downside is
that I now have to write a YAML serializer for the kernel.

## Here is what I propose for this patchset:

 - Print out test number range at the beginning of each test suite.
 - Print out log lines as soon as they happen as diagnostics.
 - Print out the lines that state whether a test passes or fails as a
ok/not ok line.

This would be technically conforming with TAP13 and is consistent with
what some kselftests have done.

## To be done in a future patchset:

Add a YAML serializer and print out some logs containing structured
data (like expectation failures, unexpected function calls, etc) in
YAML blocks.

Does this sound reasonable? I will go ahead and start working on this,
but feel free to give me feedback on the overall idea in the meantime.

Cheers
