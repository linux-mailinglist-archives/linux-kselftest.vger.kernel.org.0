This would not be the first time that a patch submitter has been
told "do B instead of A" for version 1, then told "do C instead of
B" for version 2, then told "do A instead of C" for the final version.

It sucks, but it happens.

As an aside, can you point to where the "clear policy in place" is
documented, and what the policy is?
