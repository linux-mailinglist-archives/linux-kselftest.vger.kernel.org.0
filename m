Shadow stack underflow should fault on attempt to access
non-shadow-stack memory as shadow-stack, no?

I don't think that's as big a problem as it sounds like. It might make
pinpointing the spot at which things went wrong take a little bit more
work, but it should not admit any wrong-execution.

That seems fine.

I would think the existing guard pages would already do that if a
thread's shadow stack is contiguous with its own data stack.

From the musl side, I have always looked at the entirely of shadow
stack stuff with very heavy skepticism, and anything that breaks
existing interface contracts, introduced places where apps can get
auto-killed because a late resource allocation fails, or requires
applications to code around the existence of something that should be
an implementation detail, is a non-starter. To even consider shadow
stack support, it must truely be fully non-breaking.

AIUI the proposal by Stefan makes it non-leaking because it's just
using normal memory that reverts to normal usage on any
non-shadow-stack access.
