Right, this use case is legitimate, e.g. first giving access to
~/Downloads and then another layer giving access to ~/ (because it
doesn't know about the current restriction).

I think that neither my initial approach nor yours fit well, but I found
a new one inspired from both approaches. The first solution I gave, and
since implemented in the v15 [1], can manage 2^31-1 layers but it only
works when refining a security policy *knowing the parent one* (i.e.
refining an access tied to an inode, not a full file hierarchy). Instead
of having a layer level and a layer depth, my new implementation (for
v16) use a layer bitfield for each rule (and ruleset). We still AND
access rights when merging rulesets, but instead of storing the last
layer lever and depth, we set the corresponding bit in the layer
bitfield of the rule. This way we don't consume more memory than the v15
implementation (for 64 layers top, which would be 64 bits * number of
access types with your approach, i.e. between 1KB and 2KB) and Landlock
can properly manage supersets of access rights in nested hierarchies,
whatever their stacking order. However, I don't see another solution to
better handle more than 64 layers than a VLA, but that could come later.
