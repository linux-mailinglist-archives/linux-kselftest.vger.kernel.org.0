That by the way is broken or at least misleading.

Looking at the sealing stuff, it's only available for memfds, i.e.,
memfd_create(). Any non-memfds have F_SEAL_SEAL set meaning that setting
seals on any non-memfds fails.

But your check is available on any tmpfs or hugetlbfs file in addition
to memfds. In fact, it available for any file/fd...

But it has unclear meaning for anything that isn't a memfd_create() memfd.

I see your concern but first, the fact that memfd_create() was
implemented as a multiplexer over different filesystem types was a
deliberate choice. But that's not an argument to make us absorb an
ill-defined fcntl() addition. We're just up for a repeat if you decide
to add yet more fcntl()s later.

Second, looking at:

memfd_fcntl()
-> memfd_get_seals()
   -> memfd_file_seals_ptr()
      {
              if (shmem_file(file))
                      return &SHMEM_I(file_inode(file))->seals;
      
      #ifdef CONFIG_HUGETLBFS
              if (is_file_hugepages(file))
                      return &HUGETLBFS_I(file_inode(file))->seals;
      #endif
      
              return NULL;
      }

If you have a third backend then you need to handle that anyway. You
even need to add a new seals inode member to that new backend. So you
already fiddle with each backend to accomodate memfds.

Whether you do that to as a wrapper located in mm/memfd.c that's
callable from the fses ioctl implementation or through memfd_fcntl()
really isn't any more complicated.

It's not surprising at all. It's how read-write fds are created.
memfd_create() is the oddball because it uses an internal tmpfs
kernmount that's never remountable read-only afaict otherwise this would
be pretty broken as memfd_create() doesn't do the usual mark sb writable
and get write access to the mount dance and so the mount or sb could go
ro behind it's back.

And this has zero meaning for non-memfd. So NAK on fcntl(). However, as
an ioctl() on memfd backends we won't care.

And I would suggest to figure out a nicer way to differentiate between
memfd_create() and regular tmpfs/hugetlbfs files. So you can explicitly
detect them instead of this implict F_SEAL_SEALS dance. For example,
abuse a higher flag bit in unsigned int seals that both tmpfs and
hugetlbfs already have and set F_MEMFD or whatever. Or some other
mechanism. Just a thought.

Really, fcntl() is wrong here.
