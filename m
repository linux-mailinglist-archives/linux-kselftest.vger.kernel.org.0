I appreciate Arnd's comments, but I do not think that making 47-bit the
default is the best solution for riscv. On riscv, support for 48-bit
address spaces was merged in 5.17 and support for 57-bit address spaces
was merged in 5.18 without changing the default addresses provided by
mmap(). It could be argued that this was a mistake, however since at the
time there didn't exist hardware with larger address spaces it wasn't an
issue. The applications that existed at the time that relied on the
smaller address spaces have not been able to move to larger address
spaces. Making a 47-bit user-space address space default solves the
problem, but that is not arch agnostic, and can't be since of the
varying differences in page table sizes across architectures, which is
the other part of the problem I am trying to solve.

Yes you are totally right! Although this is not my ideal solution, it
sufficiently accomplishes the goal so I think it is reasonable to
implement this as a personality flag.
