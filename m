And this special handling is?

we would?

This simply has to be done before returning to user space no matter
what. And _we_ can't do that. Please do not impersonate code.

Please add a comment why this needs to be a locked instruction.

I surely appreciate the well thought out hardware design which requires
yet another rdmsrl/wrmsrl pair here.

Of course this is invoked unconditionally when the CPU has
X86_FEATURE_UINTR:

> +		switch_uintr_return();

Why?

If the sequence is:

     syscall()
     do_stuff()
     return_to_user()

then what on earth has modified that MSR state? Nothing at all, but you
still run this code. What for?

Hardcoded random numbers ...

Hardcoded numerical shift value...

Right, because if the task did not go through schedule() this state has not
been changed at all and therefore you need to clear SN just in case to
make sure that it hasn't been set by accident, right?

So sending an self IPI is more performant than doing it purely in
memory with some care? I seriously doubt that.

Oh well, I was under the impression that this is about performance and
not about adding as much overhead as possible.

But what do I know....
