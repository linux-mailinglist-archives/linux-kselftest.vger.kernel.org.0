I do not remember details about mktme but from what I still recall it
had keys associated with direct maps. Is the key management something
that fits into flags management?

Are those very HW specific features really viable through a generic
syscall? Don't get me wrong but I find it much more likely somebody will
want a hugetlb (pretty HW independent) without a direct map than a very
close to the HW caching mode soon.

But thanks for the clarification anyway.
