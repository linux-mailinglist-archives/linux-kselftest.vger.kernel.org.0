So, to do it similar to hugetlbfs (e.g., with CMA), there would have to 
be a mechanism to actually try pre-reserving (e.g., from the CMA area), 
at which point in time the pages would get moved to the secretmem pool, 
and a mechanism for mmap() etc. to "reserve" from these secretmem pool, 
such that there are guarantees at fault time?

What we have right now feels like some kind of overcommit (reading, as 
overcommiting huge pages, so we might get SIGBUS at fault time).

TBH, the SIGBUS thingy doesn't sound terrible to me - if this behavior 
is to be expected right now by applications using it and they can handle 
it - no guarantees. I fully agree that some kind of 
reservation/guarantee mechanism would be preferable.
