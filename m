I guess this will be reworked anyway, but I'd prefer this didn't need
custom errors etc. If we agree to decoupling the selection and GET
output, it could be:

bool is_interesting_page(p, flags); // this one does the
required/anyof/excluded match
size_t output_range(p, start, len, flags); // this one fills the
output vector and returns how many pages were fit

In this setup, `is_interesting_page() && (n_out =3D output_range()) <
n_pages` means this is the final range, no more will fit. And if
`n_out =3D=3D 0` then no pages fit and no WP is needed (no other special
cases).

How about calculating `is_written =3D is_uffd_registered() &&
is_uffd_wp()`? This would enable a user to apply GET+WP for the whole
address space of a process regardless of whether all of it is
registered.

I think we should have a way of detecting the supported flags if we
don't want a forward compatibility policy for flags here. Maybe it
would be enough to allow all the no-op combinations for this purpose?

mincore() doesn't take parameters as a struct, but as three positional
arguments (whose names don't matter nor appear at call point) - I
wouldn't take it as a precedent for structure field naming.

After fixing `return_mask` and the selection/action split I think
"pages found" might work - as now the count will be exactly what pages
match the required/anyof/excluded criteria.

Yes, that one.
