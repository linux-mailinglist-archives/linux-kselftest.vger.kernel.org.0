If you want to do this for multple files, use io_ring, that's what it
was designed for.  I think Jens was going to be adding support for the
open/read/close pattern to it as well, after some other more pressing
features/fixes were finished.

There's not much (but it is mesurable) need to prefetch virtual files
into memory first, which is primarily what this syscall is for (procfs,
sysfs, securityfs, etc.)  If you are dealing with real-disks, then yes,
the overhead of the syscall might be in the noise compared to the i/o
path of the data.

Again, that's what io_uring is for.
