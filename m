I mean, it is still not perfect, but I think it has finally gotten to
the point where I prefer it over reviewing by email for high context
patches where you don't expect a lot of deep discussion.

Still not great for patches where you want to have a lot of discussion.

I think Snowpatch is an ozlabs project; at least the maintainer works at IBM.

Patchwork originally was a ozlabs project, right?

Has any discussion taken place trying to consolidate some of the forks?

Presubmit clearly seems like a feature that a number of people want.

Oooh, nice! That looks awesome! Looks like you have a number of presubmits too.

Nice! There are obviously a lot of other bots on various kernel
mailing lists. Do you think people would object to sending presubmit
results to the mailing lists by default?

Err, looks like you forked from the ozlab's repo a good while ago.

Still, this all looks great!
