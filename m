Ah ok - thanks for the clarification.

Agreed, that's fine.

The hint only works if the hint address is actually free. Otherwise
mmap() falls back to as if the hint address wasn't specified.

E.g.

> 	for(int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
> 		void *addr = mmap((void*)(1UL << 32), PAGE_SIZE, PROT_NONE, MAP_SHARED | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
> 		printf("%p\n", addr);
> 	}

Prints something like:

0x100000000
0x7f20d21e0000

The hint is ignored for the second mmap() because there's already a VMA
at the hint address.

So the question is how to generate a hint value that is (or has a high
likelihood of being) empty? This AFAICT is the LuaJIT approach, but
their approach is to pick random values in the hope of getting a free
address (and then working linearly up for subsequent allocations). Which
doesn't meet my idea of "robust".

Well that's not what *I* am looking for. A mmap_max_addr might be useful
for others for the purpose of restricting all allocations.

I think there are roughly three classes of application:

 1. Applications which do nothing special with pointers. This is most
applications and they could benefit from any future expansions to the VA
size without any modification. E.g. if 64 bit VA addresses were somehow
available they could deal with them today (without recompilation).

 2. Applications which need VA addresses to meet certain requirements.
They might be emulating another architecture (e.g. FEX) and want
pointers that can be exposed to the emulation. They might be aware of
restrictions in JIT code (e.g. PHP). Or they might want to store
pointers in 'weird' ways which involve fewer bits - AFAICT that's the
LuaJIT situation. These applications are usually well aware that they
are doing something "unusual" and would likely use a Linux API if it
existed.

 3. Applications which abuse the top bits of a VA because they've read
the architecture documentation and they "know" that the VA space is limited.

Class 3 would benefit from mmap_max_addr - either because the
architecture has been extended (although that's been worked around by
requiring the hint value to allocate into the top address space) or
because they get ported to another architecture (which I believe is the
RiscV issue). There is some argument these applications are buggy but
"we don't break userspace" so we deal with them in kernel until they get
ported and then ideally the bugs are fixed.

Class 1 is the applications we know and love, they don't need anything
special.

Class 2 is the case I care about. The application knows it wants special
addresses, and in the cases I've detailed there has been significant
code written to try to achieve this. But the kernel isn't currently
providing a good mechanism to do this.

Very true, and one of the reasons I don't want to do a mmap3() is that
I'm pretty I'd miss something.

And that's the other major reason ;)
