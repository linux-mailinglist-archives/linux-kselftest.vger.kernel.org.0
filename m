Why have it at all if it always has to be all 1s?

which ones?

Why have it, if none are ever set?

I feel like I have no idea what these bits are...

Anyway, please send a real patch, with real code, so we have a better
idea of what is happening.  AFTER you have tested and made it all work
properly.
