I prefer emails because I'm not very fluent when speaking in English and 
may have a difficultly to listen to other people, but I may try it in 
future.

Right. Container runtimes will not pass CAP_BPF by default, but that 
restriction can be lifted and I think that's a valid scenario.

Doesn't it mean that the kernel is free to break old versions of QEMU 
including BPF programs? That's something I'd like to avoid.

I also expect BPF kfuncs will work well for long if I introduce its 
usage to QEMU in practice. That said, the interface stability is about 
when something unexpected happens. What if the interface QEMU relies on 
is deemed sub-optimal? Without following kernel releases, QEMU may 
accidentally lose the feature relying on eBPF.

Personally I'm confident that the initial UAPI design will not do a bad 
thing at least. However, there is a high chance that the design needs to 
be extended to accommodate new features.

Yes. Containers can be used to 1) have a different userspace or 2) 
isolate things for security.

Regarding 2), QEMU and libvirt has sandbox mechanisms so we can rely on 
them instead of containers so we can just pass capabilities to the 
container. At least, we can always have a setuid helper outside 
container, and pass around file descriptors it generates.

So 1) is the only problem that matters.

I expect it's possible to have testing ioctls. Quickly searching online, 
there are experimental ioctls[1][2]. I also know DRM has a relaxed 
policy for closed-source userspace[3].

So I'm seeing the distinction of UAPI/kfunc even less definitive; UAPIs 
can also be broken if the subsystem maintainers agree and there is no 
real user. I also think it's natural to say a kfunc will be stable as 
long as there is a user, but it contradicts with the current situation. 
kfunc is expressed as EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL in the documentation, and Linus 
expects kfunc is for users like big companies or systemd, which closely 
follow the kernel, according to the systemd discussion I cited in the 
last email.

According to the discussion above, it may be better off abandoning BPF 
and implementing all in kernel, with ioctl as I have a (hopefully) sound 
idea of UAPI design. But I'll also continue considering the BPF option; 
BPF is still attractive due to its extensibility and safety.
