While discussing the ABI implications of shadow stacks in the context of
Zicfiss and musl a few days ago, I had the following idea for how to solve
the source compatibility problems with shadow stacks in POSIX.1-2004 and
POSIX.1-2017:

1. Introduce a "flexible shadow stack handling" option.  For what follows,
   it doesn't matter if this is system-wide, per-mm, or per-vma.

2. Shadow stack faults on non-shadow stack pages, if flexible shadow stack
   handling is in effect, cause the affected page to become a shadow stack
   page.  When this happens, the page filled with invalid address tokens.

   Faults from non-shadow-stack accesses to a shadow-stack page which was
   created by the previous paragraph will cause the page to revert to
   non-shadow-stack usage, with or without clearing.

   Important: a shadow stack operation can only load a valid address from
   a page if that page has been in continuous shadow stack use since the
   address was written by another shadow stack operation; the flexibility
   delays error reporting in cases of stray writes but it never allows for
   corruption of shadow stack operation.

3. Standards-defined operations which use a user-provided stack
   (makecontext, sigaltstack, pthread_attr_setstack) use a subrange of the
   provided stack for shadow stack storage.  I propose to use a shadow
   stack size of 1/32 of the provided stack size, rounded up to a positive
   integer number of pages, and place the shadow stack allocation at the
   lowest page-aligned address inside the provided stack region.

   Since page usage is flexible, no change in page permissions is
   immediately needed; this merely sets the initial shadow stack pointer for
   the new context.

   If the shadow stack grew in the opposite direction to the architectural
   stack, it would not be necessary to pick a fixed direction.

4. SIGSTKSZ and MINSIGSTKSZ are increased by 2 pages to provide sufficient
   space for a minimum-sized shadow stack region and worst case alignment.

_Without_ doing this, sigaltstack cannot be used to recover from stack
overflows if the shadow stack limit is reached first, and makecontext
cannot be supported without memory leaks and unreportable error conditions.

Kernel-allocated shadow stacks with a unique VM type are still useful since
they allows stray writes to crash at the time the stray write is performed,
rather than delaying the crash until the next shadow stack read.

The pthread and makecontext changes could be purely libc side, but we would
need kernel support for sigaltstack and page usage changes.

Luckily, there is no need to support stacks which are simultaneously used
from more than one process, so "is this a shadow stack page" can be tracked
purely at the vma/pte level without any need to involve the inode.  POSIX
explicitly allows using mmap to obtain stack memory and does not forbid
MAP_SHARED; I consider this sufficiently perverse application behavior that
it is not necessary to ensure exclusive use of the underlying pages while
a shadow stack pte exists.  (Applications that use MAP_SHARED for stacks
do not get the full benefit of the shadow stack but they keep POSIX.1-2004
conformance, applications that allocate stacks exclusively in MAP_PRIVATE
memory lose no security.)

The largest complication of this scheme is likely to be that the shadow
stack usage property of a page needs to survive the page being swapped out
and back in, which likely means that it must be present in the swap PTE.

I am substantially less familiar with GCS and SHSTK than with Zicfiss.
It is likely that a syscall or other mechanism is needed to initialize the
shadow stack in flexible memory for makecontext.

Is there interest on the kernel side on having mechanisms to fully support
POSIX.1-2004 with GCS or Zicfiss enabled?
