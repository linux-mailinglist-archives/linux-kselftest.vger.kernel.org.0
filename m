BTW for some reason your mailer keeps adding new lines per each line. I
trim them below. Also for future emails please Cc:

  Mimi Zohar <zohar@linux.ibm.com>

As she'll be interested in some of this from the IMA security perspective.

OK I see he did he liked the approach. OK thanks! This will make

Right, but in the new approach you'd use a newer function name with
the new feature.

Yes this makes sense. But I want to take a bit step back right now and
think about this a bit more. I'm starting to wonder if this whole sysfs
stuff should be replaced with a better scalable scheme. Consider all the
fancy things you can do in userspace with a block device. Offsets are
already supported, and so much more. So I'm starting to think that the
firmware fallback upload sysfs interface is much better suited as a
really simple block device long term.

I understand you want your solutions addressed upstream yesterday, but
this is the *sort of review* on architecture that should have been
done for the request_firmware_into_buf() long ago. But since you
probably don't want to wait for a revamp of the interface, a middle
ground might be in order for now, with the roadmap put in place to
evaluate scalable alternatives.

Either way, we should consider the current bug you ran into for the
solutions put forward, with the new functionality you are proposing.

The core of the issue you ran into was the duplicate named kobjects,
which are reflected also on the sysfs hierarchy. The directory name
created for each firmware request, when duplicate entries exist for
one device collide. Upon a secondary request for firmware using the
fallback interface, the kobject/directory already exists.

Its easier to understand this from a directory hierarchy perspective.
For instance the test driver uses:

/sys/devices/virtual/misc/test_firmware/

The test script for the test_firmware driver uses:

DIR=/sys/devices/virtual/misc/test_firmware/

To load firmware we use a directory underneath this firmware name for
the file name of the firmware requested, so to load firmware called
$name on the test script we use:

echo 1 >"$DIR"/"$name"/loading                                          
cat "$file" >"$DIR"/"$name"/data                                        
echo 0 >"$DIR"/"$name"/loading

An issue no one has cared for, and also we have not hit yet is that,
this implies no firmware names can be used which match other sysfs
attributes exported by a driver. I'm not too concerned for this right
now, but it is a worthy thing to consider long term under a new
solution.

So the issue is that the firmware loader will try to create two equally
named entries underneath the firmware loader directory. Yes we can
sledge hammer the API to act serially, but this is will just
just move one problem to another, your secondary call would have to
wait until the first one not only completes the call, but also
release_firmware() is called.

I'm looking at using a device name prefix if we do add a new API
or functionality. This way userspace can expend and knows what
extra tag to use other than the driver name.
