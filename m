Yes.  But that is not the only environment that KUnit must support to be
of use to me for devicetree unittests (this is not new, Brendan is quite
aware of my needs and is not ignoring them).

I have been following the RFC versions.  I have installed the RFC patches
and run them to the extent that they worked (devicetree unittests were
a guinea pig for test conversion in the RFC series, but the converted
tests did not work).  I read portions of the code while trying to
understand the unittests conversion.  I made review comments based on
the portion of the code that I did read.  I have read the documentation
(very nice btw, as I have said before, but should be expanded).

My comment is that the description to submit the patch series should
be fuller -- KUnit potentially has a lot of nice attributes, and I
still think I have only scratched the surface.  The average reviewer
may have even less in-depth knowledge than I do.  And as I have
commented before, I keep diving into areas that I had no previous
experience with (such as kselftest) to be able to properly judge this
patch series.
