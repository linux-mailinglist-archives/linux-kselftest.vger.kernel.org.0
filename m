I wonder if it is worth to have then different types of tests based on
locking requirements. One with no locking, since it seems you imply
most tests would fall under this category, then locking, and another
with IRQ context.

If no locking is done at all for all tests which do not require locking,
is there any gains at run time? I'm sure it might be minimum but
curious.

Since its a new architecture and since you seem to imply most tests
don't require locking or even IRQs disabled, I think its worth to
consider the impact of adding such extreme locking requirements for
an initial ramp up.
