Right, I can't think of a generic way to peg this. I think long term
we do stand to gain to move all selftests under a lib/debug/selftests/
or something like that, but for now what I suggested is the only thing
I can come up with.

Works with me.

They can peg the module if they want the taint.

That is what I was thinking.

I'm convinced we *should* move selftests to a one directory. The
amount of stuff in lib/ is getting out of hand.
