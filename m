It also is a measurable increase over reading just a single file.
Here's my really really fast AMD system doing just one call to readfile
vs. one call sequence to open/read/close:

	$ ./readfile_speed -l 1
	Running readfile test on file /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/meltdown for 1 loops...
	Took 3410 ns
	Running open/read/close test on file /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/meltdown for 1 loops...
	Took 3780 ns

370ns isn't all that much, yes, but it is 370ns that could have been
used for something else :)

Look at the overhead these days of a syscall using something like perf
to see just how bad things have gotten on Intel-based systems (above was
AMD which doesn't suffer all the syscall slowdowns, only some).

I'm going to have to now dig up my old rpi to get the stats on that
thing, as well as some Intel boxes to show the problem I'm trying to
help out with here.  I'll post that for the next round of this patch
series.

Of course you can make it more complex if you want, but look at the
existing tools that currently do many open/read/close sequences.  The
apis there don't lend themselves very well to knowing the larger list of
files ahead of time.  But I could be looking at the wrong thing, what
userspace programs are you thinking of that could be easily converted
into using something like this?
