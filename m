Hi Mike,

I'd like to stress again that I'd prefer *any* secretmem allocations 
going via CMA as long as these pages are unmovable. The user can 
allocate a non-significant amount of unmovable allocations only fenced 
by the mlock limit, which behave very different to mlocked pages - they 
are not movable for page compaction/migration.

Assume you have a system with quite some ZONE_MOVABLE memory (esp. in 
virtualized environments), eating up a significant amount of 
!ZONE_MOVABLE memory dynamically at runtime can lead to non-obvious 
issues. It looks like you have plenty of free memory, but the kernel 
might still OOM when trying to do kernel allocations e.g., for 
pagetables. With CMA we at least know what we're dealing with - it 
behaves like ZONE_MOVABLE except for the owner that can place unmovable 
pages there. We can use it to compute statically the amount of 
ZONE_MOVABLE memory we can have in the system without doing harm to the 
system.

Ideally, we would want to support page migration/compaction and allow 
for allocation from ZONE_MOVABLE as well. Would involve temporarily 
mapping, copying, unmapping. Sounds feasible, but not sure which 
roadblocks we would find on the way.

This was also raised on lwn.net by "dullfire" [1]. I do wonder if it 
would be the right place as well.
