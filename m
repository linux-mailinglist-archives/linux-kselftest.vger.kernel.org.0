Good to hear that.

This is interesting and can be a valuable addition to this series.

No doubt this series is initially designed for confidential computing
usages, but pKVM can definitely extend it if it finds useful.

For confidential computing usages, this is actually the same. The shared
or private is determined by initial configuration or guest hypercalls.

Let me understand this a bit: pKVM basically wants to maintain the
shared and private memory in only one fd, and not use userspace_addr at
all, right? Any blocking for pKVM to use private_fd + userspace_addr
instead?

I understand there is difficulty to achieve that with the current
private_fd + userspace_addr (they basically in two separate fds), but is
it possible for pKVM to extend this? Brainstorming for example, pKVM can
ignore userspace_addr and only use private_fd to cover both shared and
private memory, or pKVM introduce new KVM memslot flag?

There is discussion on removing MFD_INACCESSIBLE and delaying the
alignment of the flag to the KVM/backing store binding time
(https://lkml.kernel.org/lkml/20220824094149.GA1383966@chaop.bj.intel.com/).

Creating new API like what you are playing with fcntl() also works if it
turns out the MFD_INACCESSIBLE has to be set at the memfd_create time.

Thanks.

It gets set in kvm_private_mem_register() of patch 13, basically those
flags are expected to be set by architecture code.

With KVM_MEM_PRIVATE memslot flag, the MEMFILE_F_* are enforced by the
architecture code.

I would like to, but currently I have no travel plan due to COVID-19 :(
We can have more online discussions anyway.
