The second two look to just be news articles quoting the first without 
any real new information, at least just from skimming them -- sorry if I 
missed something, though.

The article says "SDK released with necessary software already ported to 
Veyron" and "Veyron V1 Development Platform available", but aside from 
quotes of the press release I can't find information on either of those 
(or anything VT1 related, as there were some naming ambiguities).

Anup said during the call that they're still bringing up the chip and 
haven't started sampling yet, which usually means things are far from 
publicly availiable.  I thought I heard him say that these press 
releases would say the chip is sampling 2H23, but I can't find anything 
in them about sampling.

Anup also said it's availiable as IP and I remember something at Hot 
Chips talking about an example place and route for a VT1, which also 
sounds very much like a chip that's not availiable yet -- usually if 
there's a chip folks are a lot more concrete about that sort of thing.

So is there you can point to about this chip actually being publicly 
availiable?
