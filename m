The arm64 Guarded Control Stack (GCS) feature provides support for
hardware protected stacks of return addresses, intended to provide
hardening against return oriented programming (ROP) attacks and to make
it easier to gather call stacks for applications such as profiling.

When GCS is active a secondary stack called the Guarded Control Stack is
maintained, protected with a memory attribute which means that it can
only be written with specific GCS operations.  The current GCS pointer
can not be directly written to by userspace.  When a BL is executed the
value stored in LR is also pushed onto the GCS, and when a RET is
executed the top of the GCS is popped and compared to LR with a fault
being raised if the values do not match.  GCS operations may only be
performed on GCS pages, a data abort is generated if they are not.

The combination of hardware enforcement and lack of extra instructions
in the function entry and exit paths should result in something which
has less overhead and is more difficult to attack than a purely software
implementation like clang's shadow stacks.

This series implements support for use of GCS by userspace, along with
support for use of GCS within KVM guests.  It does not enable use of GCS
by either EL1 or EL2, this will be implemented separately.  Executables
are started without GCS and must use a prctl() to enable it, it is
expected that this will be done very early in application execution by
the dynamic linker or other startup code.  For dynamic linking this will
be done by checking that everything in the executable is marked as GCS
compatible.

x86 has an equivalent feature called shadow stacks, this series depends
on the x86 patches for generic memory management support for the new
guarded/shadow stack page type and shares APIs as much as possible.  As
there has been extensive discussion with the wider community around the
ABI for shadow stacks I have as far as practical kept implementation
decisions close to those for x86, anticipating that review would lead to
similar conclusions in the absence of strong reasoning for divergence.

The main divergence I am concious of is that x86 allows shadow stack to
be enabled and disabled repeatedly, freeing the shadow stack for the
thread whenever disabled, while this implementation keeps the GCS
allocated after disable but refuses to reenable it.  This is to avoid
races with things actively walking the GCS during a disable, we do
anticipate that some systems will wish to disable GCS at runtime but are
not aware of any demand for subsequently reenabling it.

x86 uses an arch_prctl() to manage enable and disable, since only x86
and S/390 use arch_prctl() a generic prctl() was proposed[1] as part of a
patch set for the equivalent RISC-V Zicfiss feature which I initially
adopted fairly directly but following review feedback has been revised
quite a bit.

We currently maintain the x86 pattern of implicitly allocating a shadow
stack for threads started with shadow stack enabled, there has been some
discussion of removing this support and requiring the use of clone3()
with explicit allocation of shadow stacks instead.  I have no strong
feelings either way, implicit allocation is not really consistent with
anything else we do and creates the potential for errors around thread
exit but on the other hand it is existing ABI on x86 and minimises the
changes needed in userspace code.

glibc and bionic changes using this ABI have been implemented and
tested.  Headless Android systems have been validated and Ross Burton
has used this code has been used to bring up a Yocto system with GCS
enabed as standard, a test implementation of V8 support has also been
done.

There is an open issue with support for CRIU, on x86 this required the
ability to set the GCS mode via ptrace.  This series supports
configuring mode bits other than enable/disable via ptrace but it needs
to be confirmed if this is sufficient.

The series depends on support for shadow stacks in clone3(), that series
includes the addition of ARCH_HAS_USER_SHADOW_STACK.
