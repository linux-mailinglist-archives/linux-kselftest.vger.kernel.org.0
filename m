I just realize that partition root set the CPU_EXCLUSIVE bit. So changes 
to cpuset.cpus that break exclusivity rule is not allowed anyway. This 
patchset is just adding additional checks so that cpuset.cpus changes 
that break the partition root rules will not be allowed. I can remove 
those additional checks for this patchset and allow cpuset.cpus changes 
that break the partition root rules to make it invalid instead. However, 
I still want invalid changes to cpuset.partition.type to be disallowed.

Longman
