reply 5/5

This is the previous raw console output for the Devicetree unittest,
filtered by of_unittest_expect.  The expected messages are eliminated
instead of being flagged.

Lines 1 - 205 deleted again.

The output is still somewhat noisy because the Devicetree unittest
is running in parallel with some unrelated driver initialization.

This test run shows one of the unittests failing (search for
the string "FAIL") and an associated expected console error
message is missing.

  EXPECT begin and EXPECT end lines are suppressed.
  Lines that match an EXPECT line are suppressed.
  Lines reporting a of_unittest_expect warning or error are flagged
     with a leading '**'.
  Lines reporting start or end of the unittests are flagged
     with a leading '->'.
  Lines reporting a unittest test FAIL are flagged
     with a leading '>>'.
