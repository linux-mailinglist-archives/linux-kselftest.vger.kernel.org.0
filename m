Memory protection keys enables an application to protect its address
space from inadvertent access by its own code.

This feature is now enabled on powerpc and has been available since
4.16-rc1. The patches move the selftests to arch neutral directory
and enhance their test coverage.

Tested on powerpc64 and x86_64 (Skylake-SP).

Link to development branch:
https://github.com/sandip4n/linux/tree/pkey-selftests

Resending this based on feedback from maintainers who felt this
can go in via the -mm tree. This has no other changes from the
last version (v18) apart from being rebased.

Changelog
---------
Link to previous version (v18):
https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/linuxppc-dev/list/?series=155970

v19:
	(1) Rebased on top of latest master.

v18:
	(1) Fixed issues with x86 multilib builds based on
	    feedback from Dave.
	(2) Moved patch 2 to the end of the series.

v17:
	(1) Fixed issues with i386 builds when running on x86_64
	    based on feedback from Dave.
	(2) Replaced patch 6 from previous version with patch 7.
	    This addresses u64 format specifier related concerns
	    that Michael had raised in v15.

v16:
	(1) Rebased on top of latest master.
	(2) Switched to u64 instead of using an arch-dependent
	    pkey_reg_t type for references to the pkey register
	    based on suggestions from Dave, Michal and Michael.
	(3) Removed build time determination of page size based
	    on suggestion from Michael.
	(4) Fixed comment before the definition of __page_o_noops()
	    from patch 13 ("selftests/vm/pkeys: Introduce powerpc
	    support").

v15:
	(1) Rebased on top of latest master.
	(2) Addressed review comments from Dave Hansen.
	(3) Moved code for getting or setting pkey bits to new
	    helpers. These changes replace patch 7 of v14.
	(4) Added a fix which ensures that the correct count of
	    reserved keys is used across different platforms.
	(5) Added a fix which ensures that the correct page size
	    is used as powerpc supports both 4K and 64K pages.

v14:
	(1) Incorporated another round of comments from Dave Hansen.

v13:
	(1) Incorporated comments for Dave Hansen.
	(2) Added one more test for correct pkey-0 behavior.

v12:
	(1) Fixed the offset of pkey field in the siginfo structure for
	    x86_64 and powerpc. And tries to use the actual field
	    if the headers have it defined.

v11:
	(1) Fixed a deadlock in the ptrace testcase.

v10 and prior:
	(1) Moved the testcase to arch neutral directory.
	(2) Split the changes into incremental patches.
