In an imaginary world where overlay support was completed, then _maybe_.

To me, the most important  environment to test is where the devictree
data is populated in early boot from an FDT.  This is the environment
that drivers currently exist in.

Populating devicetree data via an overlay adds in the functioning of the
overlay apply code (and how the rules behind that functioning may differ
from devicetree data populated in early boot from an FDT).

In an ideal world where overlay support was completed, most or all of the
devicetree tests that were performed against the devicetree data populated
in early boot from an FDT would be repeated, but against comparable
devicetree data populated via an overlay load.  The tests with the overlay
data may have to be aware of some differences in how an overlay load
processes an FDT vs how the early boot processing of an FDT behaves.
This extra testing would verify that the overlay environment behaves
the same as the non-overlay environment (with some known exceptions
due to overlay policies).

Overlay support is not complete:
