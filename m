I'm not sure I understand the last bit.  If you look at what copy_from_user()
does on misaligned source/destination, especially on architectures that
really, really do not like unaligned access...

Case in point: alpha (and it's not unusual in that respect).  What it boils
down to is
	copy bytes until the destination is aligned
	if source and destination are both aligned
		copy word by word
	else
		read word by word, storing the mix of two adjacent words
	copy the rest byte by byte

The unpleasant case (to and from having different remainders modulo 8) is
basically

	if (count >= 8) {
		u64 *aligned = (u64 *)(from & ~7);
		u64 *dest = (u64 *)to;
		int bitshift = (from & 7) * 8;
		u64 prev, next;

		prev = aligned[0];
		do {   
			next = aligned[1];
			prev <<= bitshift;
			prev |= next >> (64 - bitshift);
			*dest++ = prev;
			aligned++;  
			prev = next;
			from += 8;
			to += 8;
			count -= 8;
		} while (count >= 8);
	}

Now, mix that with "... and do memchr_inv() on the copy to find if we'd
copied any non-zeroes, nevermind where" and it starts looking really
ridiculous.

We should just read the fscking source, aligned down to word boundary
and check each word being read.  The first and the last ones - masked.
All there is to it.  On almost all architectures that'll work well
enough; s390 might want something more elaborate (there even word-by-word
copies are costly, but I'd suggest talking to them for details).

Something like bool all_zeroes_user(const void __user *p, size_t count)
would probably be a sane API...
