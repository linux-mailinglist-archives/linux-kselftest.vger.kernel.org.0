My point was if these pages are very much similar to our existing
definition of unevictable LRU pages then it makes more sense to
account for these pages into unevictable stat.

I suggested having a separate counter in the previous version but got
shot down based on the not-yet-clear benefit of a separate stat for
it.

There is also an option to not add new or use existing stat at this
moment. As there will be more clear use-cases and usage of secretmem,
adding a new stat at that time would be much simpler than changing the
definition of existing stats.
