If we are to get rid of VM_FAULT_OOM, vmf_error() would be updated and this
place will get the update automagically.

As David pointed out, failure to handle direct map in secretmem_fault() is
like any allocation failure in page fault handling and most of them result
in VM_FAULT_OOM, so I think that having vmf_error() in secretmem_fault() is
more consistent with the rest of the code than using VM_FAULT_SIGBUS.

Besides if the direct map manipulation failures would result in errors
other than -ENOMEM, having vmf_error() may prove useful.
