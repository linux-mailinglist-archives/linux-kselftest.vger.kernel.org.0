Sure, I have been there before, but I thought those original opinions
were based on a pretty well established convention. Also, I don't think
those original opinions have changed. If they have, please chime in and
correct me.

I get that. That is why I thought I might have been worthy of an
exception. It is definitely easier to write EXPECT_EQ(...) than
KUNIT_EXPECT_EQ(...) or TEST_EXPECT_EQ(...), but no one else seemed to
agree in the past.

Even now, it is only you (and maybe Frank?) telling me to change it; I
would like to maybe hear Shuah, Kees, or Greg chime in on this before I
go about actually chaning it back, as I distinctly remember each of them
telling me that I should go with KUNIT_*.

That's the policy I was talking about.

I don't disagree. Again, this is what I initially proposed, but no one
agreed with me on this point.

I am not saying no. Nevertheless, this is a pretty consistently applied
pattern for new stuff, and I would really prefer not to make waves on
something that really doesn't matter all that much.

So like I said, if we can get some more discussion on this and it seems
like broad consensus says we can reserve ASSERT_* and EXPECT_*, then I
will go along with it.

Global namespacing policy that Knut mentioned above.

Speaking for KUnit, you are right. I got KUnit working on other
architectures a couple revisions ago (apparently I didn't advertise that
well enough).

I agree. That is why I am saying that I think we are in good shape if we
are only arguing about the name.

Again, I agree. That is what I am trying to do here.

Yep.

Are we arguing about anything other than naming schemes here? If that's
it, we can refactor the under the hood stuff later; if we even need to
at all.

Cheers!
