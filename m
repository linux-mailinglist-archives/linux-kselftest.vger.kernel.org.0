regs->sp is *undefined* on x86-32.  We're damning our future selves to
have to always remember to use that darn kernel_stack_pointer() helper
for eternity just because of x86-32.

There have already been several bugs related to that.  Because regs->sp
is there, so why wouldn't you use it?

If we truly want the code to reflect the HW, then we should have a
pt_regs_kernel and a pt_regs_user on 32-bit.  I'm pretty sure we don't
want to go there...

IMO, we either need to make the pt_regs struct(s) match the HW behavior,
or make entry code match pt_regs.  But this in-between thing just
creates a bunch of headaches.
