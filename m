No, it's not as you can see from questions I've had above. More on that
below.

This is quite a subjective conclusion. I could very well argue that it
would be much better to have a single syscall to get a fd backed memory
with spedific requirements (sealing, unmapping from the kernel address
space). Neither of us would be clearly right or wrong. A more important
point is a future extensibility and usability, though. So let's just
think of few usecases I have outlined above. Is it unrealistic to expect
that secret memory should be sealable? What about hugetlb? Because if
the answer is no then a new API is a clear win as the combination of
flags would never work and then we would just suffer from the syscall 
multiplexing without much gain. On the other hand if combination of the
functionality is to be expected then you will have to jam it into
memfd_create and copy the interface likely causing more confusion. See
what I mean?

I by no means do not insist one way or the other but from what I have
seen so far I have a feeling that the interface hasn't been thought
through enough. Sure you have landed with fd based approach and that
seems fair. But how to get that fd seems to still have some gaps IMHO.
