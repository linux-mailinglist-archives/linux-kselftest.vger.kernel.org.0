Here's a trick: you could ask. Other people do.

Nothing is "pre accepted". Everything gets discussed and reviewed.
Specially when it comes to what you call "churn", which I call "crap
removal".

> reasons not actually merged is making it quite hard to target, you're

Things get merged when they are reviewed and ready. Not before.

This isn't about resolving a simple conflict. This is a fundamental
change in the way the state is tracked. We have argued about this for
months now, you were Cc'd on the patches addressing this problem, and
you even reviewed them. What other hint do you need?

Not clear? That's a first. I'm usually seen as "blunt and assertive".
But I'll keep that in mind and aspire to greater clarity in the future.

That, and the already merged feature enforcement framework which you
keep ignoring. I'll push out a rc3-based branch in to -next shortly so
that it is crystal clear what you need to base things on.
