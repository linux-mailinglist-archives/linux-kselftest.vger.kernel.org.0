Subject: [PATCH v8 00/12] syfs: generic deadlock fix with module removal

This is a follow up to my v7 series of fixes for the zram driver [0]
which ended up uncovering a generic deadlock issue with sysfs and module
removal. I've reported this issue and proposed a few patches first since
March 2021 [1]. At the end of this email you will find an itemized list
of changes since that v1 series, you can also find these changes on my
branch 20210927-sysfs-generic-deadlock-fix [4] which is based on
linux-next tag next-20210927.

Just a heads up, I'm goin on vacation in two days, won't be back until
Monday October 11th.

On this v8 I incorporate feedback from the v7 series, namely:

 - Tejun requested I move the struct module to the last attribute when
   extending functions
 - As per discussion with Tejun, trimmed and clarified the commit log
   and documentation on the generic fix on patch 7
 - As requested by Bart Van Assche, I simplied the setting of the
   struct test_config *config into one line instead of two on many
   places on patch 3 which adds the new sysfs selftest
 - Dan Williams had some questions about patch 7, and so clarified these
   questions using a more elaborate example on the commit log to show
   where the lock call was happening.
 - Trimmed the Cc list considerably as it was way too long before
 - Rebased onto linux-next tag next-20210927

Below a list of changes of this patch set since its inception:

On v1:
  - Open coded the sysfs deadlock race to only be localized by the zram
    driver
Changes on v2:
  - used bdgrab() as well for another race which was speculated by
    Minchan
  - improved documentation of fixes
Changes on v3:
  - used a localized zram macros for the sysfs attributes instead of
    open coding on each routine
  - replaced bdget() stuff for a generic get_device() and bus_get() on
    dev_attr_show() / dev_attr_store() for the issue speculated by
    Michan
Changes on v4:
  - Cosmetic fixes on the zram fixes as requested by Greg
  - Split out the driver core fix as requested by Greg for the
    issue speculated by Michan. This fix ended up getting up to its 4th
    patch iteration [2] and eventually hit linux-next. We got a 0day
    0day suspend stres fail for this patch [3]
Changes on v5:
  - I ended up writing a test_sysfs driver and with it I ended up
    proving that the issue speculated by Michen was not possible and
    so I asked Greg to drop the patch from his queue titled
    "sysfs: fix kobject refcount to address races with kobject removal"
  - checkpatch fixes for the zram changes
Changes on v6:
  - I submitted my test_sysfs driver for inclusion upstream which easily
    abstracted the deadlock issue in a driver generically [4]
  - I rebased the zram fixes and added also a new patch for zram to use
    ATTRIBUTE_GROUPS As per Minchen I sent the patches to be merged
    through Andrew Morton.
  - Greg ended up NACK'ing the patchset because he was not sure the fix
    was correct still
Changes on v7:
  - Formalizes the original proposed generic sysfs fix intead of using
    macro helpers to work around the issue
  - I decided it is best to merge all the effort together into
    one patch set because communication was being lost when I split the
    patches up. This was not helping in any way to either fix the zram
    issues or come to consensus on a generic solution. The patches are
    also merged now because they are all related now.
  - Running checkpatch exposed that S_IRWXUGO and S_IRWXU|S_IRUGO|S_IXUGO
    should be replaced, so I did that in this series in two new patches
  - Adds a try_module_get() documentation extension with tribal
    knowledge and new information I don't think some folks still believe
    in. The new test_sysfs selftest however proves this information to
    be correct, the same selftest can be used to try to prove that
    documentation incorrect
  - Because the fix is now generic zram's deadlock can easily be fixed
    now by just making it use ATTRIBUTE_GROUPS().
