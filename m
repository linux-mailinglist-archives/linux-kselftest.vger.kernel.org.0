A quick reply (because I don't have a lot of time at the moment).

I agree with the issues your first patch before this series addresses
and the issues the first 3 patches address.

I have not looked at the tests.

I actually disagree with most of your fixes.  Both because of
intrusiveness and because of awkwardness.  My basic problem with
your fixes is I don't think they leave the code in a more maintainable
state.

Hopefully later today I can propose some alternative fixes and we can
continue the discussion.


One thing I think you misunderstood is the capability checks in set_user
have always been there.  There is a very good argument they are badly
placed so are not exactly checking the correct credentials.  Especially
now.

Your patch 4/6 I don't think makes sense.  It has always been the
case that root without capabilities is subject to the rlimit.  If  you
are in a user namespace you are root without capabilities.
