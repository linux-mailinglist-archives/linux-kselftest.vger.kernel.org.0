If the above is true, perhaps devmem is not really supposed to be intergated
into page_pool.

Adding a checking for every per-page handling in page_pool core is just too
hacky to be really considerred a longterm solution.

It is somewhat ironical that devmem is using static_branch to alliviate the
performance impact for normal memory at the possible cost of performance
degradation for devmem, does it not defeat some purpose of intergating devmem
to page_pool?

We may need another bit/flags checking to demux between page_pool owned
devmem and non-page_pool owned devmem.

Also calling page_pool_*() on non-page_pool owned devmem is confusing
enough that we may need a thin layer handling non-page_pool owned devmem
in the end.

It would be good to have a tx implementation for the next version, so
that we can have a whole picture of devmem.
