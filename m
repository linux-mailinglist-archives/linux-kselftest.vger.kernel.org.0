Hi Shuah,

Bumping an old thread, this is still an issue for this test [1] and it
could end up affecting many others.

Is there a downside to that? There'll be some tests that take more time,
I don't think that's a problem with the tests or a reason to let them
timeout. IMO it's the test framework which should adapt to the needs of
different types of tests, and the solution provided by this patch is
good enough, it addresses the problem for this particular test suite.

If the solution is still unacceptable, do you have an alternative
proposal in mind that we can try to implement?

Thanks,
Ricardo
