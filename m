You seems to be combining comments in different thread and replying in
one thread, I am not sure that is a good practice and I almost missed the
reply below as I don't seem to be cc'ed.

Is there a reason why not calling napi_pp_put_page() for devmem too
instead of calling page_pool_page_put_many()? mem provider has a
'release_page' ops, calling page_pool_page_put_many() directly here
seems to be bypassing the 'release_page' ops, which means devmem is
bypassing most of the main features of page pool.

As far as I can tell, the main features of page pool:
1. Allow lockless allocation and freeing in pool->alloc cache by
   utilizing NAPI non-concurrent context.
2. Allow concurrent allocation and freeing in pool->ring cache by
   utilizing ptr_ring.
3. Allow dma map/unmap and cache sync optimization.
4. Allow detailed stats logging and tracing.
5. Allow some bulk allocation and freeing.
6. support both skb packet and xdp frame.

I am wondering what is the main features that devmem is utilizing
by intergrating into page pool?

It seems the driver can just call netdev_alloc_devmem() and
napi_frag_unref() can call netdev_free_devmem() directly without
intergrating into page pool and it should just works too?

Maybe we should consider creating a new thin layer, in order to
demux to page pool, devmem or other mem type if my suggestion does
not work out too?
