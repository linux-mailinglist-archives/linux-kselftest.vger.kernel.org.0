The actual first issue is the CPU hotplug remove callback is long gone and
in the meantime we allow a race to add a new "instance", in the zram
driver's case a cpu struct zcomp instance though the sysfs interface.

Regardless of if zram_remove() can fail or not, the above race needs to
be addressed.

You're addressing a possible failig zram_remove() while I address not
allowing entry to muck with the zram driver at all once we're bailing
on module removal.

Yes. And it is what my out of tree yet Acked patch, 'zram: fix     
crashes with cpu hotplug multistate' does.

Right, 'zram: fix crashes with cpu hotplug multistate' is not yet
merged, my approach to fixing that does add a lock use on module removal
which does introduce a possible deadlock with syfs, which is later addressed
generically between sysfs and module removal for all drivers.

Yes yes, but you are completely throwing out the window that other
possible deadlocks can exist in the kernel *and* that *new* cases of
the deadlock can easily also be added!

So far your patches do not fix the issues though...

And just like that you are ignoring other possible uses in the kernel
which might have similar deadlocks.

So do you want to take the position:

Hey driver authors: you cannot use any shared lock on module removal and
on sysfs ops?
