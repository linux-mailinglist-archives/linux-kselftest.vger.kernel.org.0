Funnily enough we ran into issues with this when running Go code in runc
that did precisely this -- /proc/self gave you the wrong fd table in
very specific circumstances that were annoying to debug. For languages
with green-threading you can't turn off (like Go) these kinds of issues
pop up surprisingly often.

Sorry to bike-shed, but to match /proc/self and /proc/thread-self, maybe
they should be called PIDFD_SELF (for tgid) and PIDFD_THREAD_SELF (for
current's tid)? In principle I guess users might use PIDFD_SELF by
accident but if we mirror the naming with /proc/{,thread-}self that
might not be that big of an issue?

Just a thought.
