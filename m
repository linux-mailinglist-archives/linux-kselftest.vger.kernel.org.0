But that's not what happens in my example - the address where the
fault happens (0x200200) *is not* in the address range that
MADV_POISON is called on (0x1ff000-0x200100). The fault and the
MADV_POISON are in different 4KiB pages. What causes the conflict is
that the fault and the MADV_POISON overlap the same *2MiB region*
(both are in the region 0x200000-0x400000), and so THP stuff can
effectively cause "page faults in the range you are setting up poison
markers for".

We can have a bailout on signal_pending() or something like that, and
a cond_resched(). Then as far as I know, it won't really make a
difference in behavior whether the loop is in the kernel or in
userspace code that's following what the manpage tells it to do -
either way, the program will loop until it either finishes its work or
is interrupted by a signal, and either way it can get preempted.
(Well, except under PREEMPT_NONE, but that is basically asking for
long scheduling delays.)

And we do have other codepaths that have to loop endlessly if they
keep racing with page table updates the wrong way, though I guess
those loops are not going to always scan over a large address range
over and over again...

Maybe something like this would be good enough, and mirror what you'd
otherwise tell userspace to do?

Buuut, heh, actually, I just realized: You could even omit this and
simply replace -EINTR with -ERESTARTNOINTR in your code as the error
value, and then the kernel would automatically go back into the
syscall for you after going through signal handing and such, without
userspace noticing.
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20121206220955.GZ4939@ZenIV.linux.org.uk/
has some explanation on how this works. Basically it tells the
architecture's syscall entry code to move the userspace instruction
pointer back to the syscall instruction, so as soon as execution
returns to userspace, the first userspace instruction that executes
will immediately re-do the syscall. That might be the easiest way,
even if it is maybe a *little* bit of an API abuse to use this thing
without having a pending signal...

Yes, we could do -EINTR and document that for userspace, and as long
as everyone using this properly reads the documentation, it will be
fine. Though I imagine that from the userspace programmer perspective
that's a weird API design - as in, if this error code always means I
have to try again, why can't the kernel do that internally. It's kind
of leaking an implementation detail into the UAPI.
