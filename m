This is becoming more and more closer to what I have in the code. The only
difference now is that you are asking me to not return the buffer full
status from inside this function and instead there should be a input+output
pointer to n_pages and the caller would return the buffer full status. As
compared to the suggestion, the current form looks simpler. My earlier
point (
https://lore.kernel.org/all/2e1b80f1-0385-0674-ae5f-9703a6ef975d@collabora.com
) is valid again. I don't want to bring logic out of pagemap_scan_output().
This is internal function. There could be thousand ways how internal code
can be written. I've really liked so many optimizations which you have
advised. This isn't something worth doing. It would increase lines of code
with no added readability benefit.
