Well this depends on one defines work. If you use my definition of
"behaves equivalently to a hardware XRSTOR instruction" then #1
works, #2 is totally broken, and #3 is subtly broken. But #3 has
been the way that it is for a long time and the KVM maintainers
don't want to change it, whereas #2 was broken recently (in the
commit this fixes).

Yes (modulo refactoring).

Largely but not entirely, because KVM's behavior is subtly different
from XRSTOR's.
KVM doesn't reinitialize PKRU to the hardware init value if the PKRU bit is
not set in the xfeatures mask, whereas XRSTOR does (and thus ptrace previously
did).

It's telling you that nothing really changed there. I can drop that.

I don't personally care about sigreturn that much but I would like the
ptrace ABI to behave like XRSTOR (which it did before 5.14), and the
sigreturn ABI behaves like XRSTOR because it *is* XRSTOR (both
before and after 5.14), so the ptrace ABI behaving like the sigreturn ABI
arises transitively.

Ok. How about I break the first part into two pieces, one that changes the
signatures of copy_uabi_from_kernel_to_xstate() and
copy_sigframe_from_user_to_xstate(), and one that moves the relevant
KVM code from fpu_copy_uabi_to_guest_fpstate() to copy_uabi_to_xstate()
and deals with the edge case behavior of the mask?

This is necessary to avoid changing KVM's behavior at the same time
that we change
ptrace, since KVM doesn't want the same behavior as ptrace.

Right. Where we need to put PKRU to get the kernel to swap it in
varies depending
on whether this is a normal task or a VM.

Right.

So that we can also access tsk->thread.pkru at the same time.

Yeah, Sean Christopherson suggested this (with the else and if
collapsed into a single level) when I submitted this previously.
