Thank you, it is very clear now.

Only arm64, riscv and loongarch belong to the newer architectures
which are related with this change, I am not sure it is necessary
to "unify" uapi bitsperlong.h for them.

Anyway, let me try, I will send a new version, maybe this is going
to progress in the right direction.
