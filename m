Maybe you'd want a per-process option to not merge if the VM_SOFTDIRTY 
property differs. But that might be just one alternative for handling 
this case.

Let me try to find a simple explanation:

After clearing a SOFTDIRTY PTE flag inside an area with VM_SOFTDIRTY 
set, there are ways that PTE could get written to and it could become 
dirty, without the PTE becoming softdirty.

Essentially, inside a VMA with VM_SOFTDIRTY set, the PTE softdirty 
values might be stale: there might be entries that are softdirty even 
though the PTE is *not* marked softdirty.

These are, AFAIU, the current semantics, and I am not sure if we want 
user space to explicitly work around that.

Please split it out into a separate patch for now. We can discuss 
further what the semantics are and if there are better alternatives for 
that. In the meantime, you could move forward without 
PAGEMAP_NO_REUSED_REGIONS while we are discussing them further.
