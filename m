hold_cnt + release_cnt serves is used for refcounting. In this case
it'll leak the pool when you try to destroy it.

I don't think I follow. The concept is to only recycle a buffer (i.e.
make it available for allocation) when its refs drop to zero, which is
IMHO the only way it can work, and IIUC what this patchset is doing.

That's also I suggest to do, but through a slightly different path.
Let's say at some moment there are 2 refs (e.g. 1 for an skb and
1 for userspace/xarray).

Say it first puts the skb:

napi_pp_put_page()
   -> page_pool_return_page()
     -> mp_ops->release_page()
        -> need_to_free = put_buf()
           // not last ref, need_to_free==false,
           // don't recycle, don't increase release_cnt

Then you put the last ref:

page_pool_iov_put_many()
   -> page_pool_return_page()
     -> mp_ops->release_page()
        -> need_to_free = put_buf()
           // last ref, need_to_free==true,
           // recycle and release_cnt++

And that last put can even be recycled right into the
pp / ptr_ring, in which case it doesn't need to touch
release_cnt. Does it make sense? I don't see where
4-5x degradation would come from
