Let me reiterate to make sure I don't misread your suggestion.

If we make secretmem an opt-in feature with, e.g. kernel parameter, the
pooling of large pages is unnecessary. In this case there is no limited
resource we need to protect because secretmem will allocate page by page.

Since there is no limited resource, we don't need special permissions
to access secretmem so we can move forward with a system call that creates
a mmapable file descriptor and save the hassle of a chardev.

I cannot say I don't like this as it cuts roughly half of mm/secretmem.c :)

But I must say I am still a bit concerned about that we have no provisions
here for dealing with the direct map fragmentation even with the set goal
to improve the direct map management in the long run...
