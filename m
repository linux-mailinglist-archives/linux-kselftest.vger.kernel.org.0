I'm assuming that the common case is there is no writer, we attempt
lockless vma read, but then (very rarely) writer comes in and starts
to change something, disrupting the read. In uprobe vma lookup
speculation case we don't even attempt to do lockless read if there is
an active writer, we just fallback to mmap_read_lock.

So I guess in that case we don't really need many retries. Just check
if there is active writer, and if not - mmap_read_lock. If there was
no writer, speculate, and when done double-check that nothing changed.
If something changed - retry with mmap_read_lock.

Does that sound more reasonable?

In this scenario, yes, I agree that retrying isn't useful, because
writer probably is going to be quite a lot slower than fast readers.
So see above, perhaps no retries are needed beyond just lockles ->
mmap_read_lock retry. Just a quick mmap_lock_speculate_try_begin()
check at the start.

BTW, I realized that me referencing uprobe speculation is done with no
context or code pointers. I'm talking about
find_active_uprobe_speculative() in kernel/events/uprobes.c, if you
are curious.

I think so, though not 100% sure I got all the points you are raising.
But see above if my thoughts make sense to you :)
