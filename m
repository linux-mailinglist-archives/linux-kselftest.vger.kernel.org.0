Dan's proposal here is a good start, but the "sleep in cdev_del() until
the device drains all existing opens" is going to not really work well
for what we want.

So sure, make a new cdev api to use this, that's fine, then we will have
what, 5 different ways to use a cdev?  :)

Seriously, that would be good, then we can work to convert things over,
but I think overall it will look much the same as what patch 5/5 does
here.  But details matter, I don't really known for sure...

Either way, I think this patch series stands on its own, it doesn't
require cdev to implement it, drivers can use it to wrap a cdev if they
want to.  We have other structures that want to do this type of thing
today as is proof with the rust implementation for the devm api.
