It takes some thinking about, but the i_size check is required to be
under the pagetable lock, for the MAP_PRIVATE UFFDIO_COPY path, where
it is inserting an anonymous page into the file-backed vma (skipping
actually inserting a page into page cache, as an ordinary fault would).

Not because of FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE (which makes no change to i_size;
and it's okay if a race fills in the hole immediately afterwards),
but because of truncation (which must remove all beyond i_size).

In the MAP_SHARED case, with a locked page inserted into page cache,
the page lock is enough to exclude concurrent truncation.  But even
in that case the second i_size check (I'm looking at 5.12-rc's
shmem_mfill_atomic_pte(), rather than recent patches which might differ)
is required: because the first i_size check was done before the page
became visible in page cache, so a concurrent truncation could miss it).

Maybe that first check is redundant, though I'm definitely for doing it;
or maybe shmem_add_to_page_cache() would be better if it made that check
itself, under xas_lock (I think the reason it does not is historical).
The second check, in the MAP_SHARED case, does not need to be under
pagetable lock - the page lock on the page cache page is enough -
but probably Andrea placed it there to resemble the anonymous case.

You might then question, how come there is no i_size check in all of
mm/memory.c, where ordinary faulting is handled.  I'll answer that
the pte_same() check, under pagetable lock in wp_page_copy(), is
where the equivalent to userfaultfd's MAP_PRIVATE UFFDIO_COPY check
is made: if the page cache page has already been truncated, that pte
will have been cleared.

Or, if the page cache page is truncated an instant after wp_page_copy()
drops page table lock, then the unmap_mapping_range(,,, even_cows = 1)
which follows truncation has to clean it up.  Er, does that mean that
the i_size check I started off insisting is required, actually is not
required?  Um, maybe, but let's just keep it and say goodnight!
