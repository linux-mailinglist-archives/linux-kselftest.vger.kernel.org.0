I'm coming back to this now after reading the rest of the patches that
deal with assertions and expectations. It looks like the string stream
is there to hold a few different pieces of information:

 - Line Number
 - File Name
 - Function Name

The above items could be stored in a structure on the stack that then
gets printed and formatted when the expectation or assertion fails. That
would make the whole string stream structure and code unnecessary.

The only hypothetical case where this can't be done is a complicated
assertion or expectation that does more than one check and can't be
written as a function that dumps out what went wrong. Is this a real
problem? Maybe such an assertion should just open code that logic so we
don't have to build up a string for all the other simple cases.

It seems far simpler to get rid of the string stream API and just have a
struct for this.

	struct kunit_fail_msg {
		const char *line;
		const char *file;
		const char *func;
		const char *msg;
	};

Then you can have the assertion macros create this on the stack (with
another macro?).

	#define DEFINE_KUNIT_FAIL_MSG(name, _msg) \
		struct kunit_fail_msg name =3D { \
			.line =3D  __LINE__, \
			.file =3D __FILE__, \
			.func =3D __func__, \
			.msg =3D _msg, \
		}

Note: I don't know if the __LINE__ above will use the macro location, so
this probably needs another wrapper to put the right line number there.

I don't want to derail this whole series on this topic, but it seems
like a bunch of code is there to construct this same set of information
over and over again into a buffer a little bit at a time and then throw
it away when nothing fails just because we may want to support the case
where we have some unstructured data to inform the user about.

Why not build in the structured part into the framework (i.e. the struct
above) so that it's always there and then add the string building part
later when we have to?
