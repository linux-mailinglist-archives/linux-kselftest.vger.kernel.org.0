The statement about us not being able to dictate which dual licensing
options a submitter selects does not actually come from me, Thomas noted
this [0].

I helped spearhead some of that effort.

Correct, and I noted my own reasoning for now dual licensing with
copyleft-next, which you seem to be disregarding?

And I noted in my cover letter that copyleft-next-0.3.1 has been found to be
to be GPLv2 compatible by three attorneys at SUSE and Redhat [1], but
to err on the side of caution we simply recommend to always use the "OR"
language for this license [2].

You say number of legal issues.

But the above seems to indicate one technical pain point in so far as
two sections:

4. Condition Against Further Restrictions; Inbound License Compatibility
7. Nullification of Copyleft/Proprietary Dual Licensing

If you are going to offer to pay for an alternative proprietary
licensing, I'm sure you can do the work.

And if in so far as clause 4 is concerned, yeah I think wayback machine
is a sensible solution. Good idea, seems like we have that covered since
1999 [3].
