The first issue I experienced was that

printf("%*s", 1, "foo") would segfault because it ignored the '*' and
just tried to interpret the number "1" as string.
When looking for the supported features of the printf implementation
there were no examples.

And before I try to add code to handle this case better I really want
some testcases.

The idea was that printf is its own very special beast that alone is
more complex than many other things combined.
When working on it, it would be useful to only run the relevant tests
without having to manually count testcase numbers.

I don't expect other single functions getting their own category.

If you still prefer to put it somewhere else I can do that, too.
