Nice series, but you are 3 months late with it...  Next AFD, perhaps?

Seriously, the rationale is bollocks.  If the overhead of 2 extra
syscalls is anywhere near the costs of the real work being done by
that thing, we have already lost and the best thing to do is to
throw the system away and start with saner hardware.
