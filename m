You have a point there, I guess having a type argument is enough. (And
if userspace tries to load a ruleset with "deny" rules that isn't
supported by the current kernel, userspace will have to deal with that
in some way anyway.)

So thinking about it more, I guess the current version is probably
actually fine, too.
