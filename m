I'm on the Android pKVM team at Google, and we've been looking into
how this approach fits with what we've been doing with pkvm/arm64.
I've had a go at porting your patches, along with some fixes and
additions so it would go on top of our latest pkvm patch series [1] to
see how well this proposal fits with what we=E2=80=99re doing. You can find
the ported code at this link [2].

In general, an fd-based approach fits very well with pKVM for the
reasons you mention. It means that we don't necessarily need to map
the guest memory, and with the new extensions it allows the host
kernel to control whether to restrict migration and swapping.

For pKVM, we would also need the guest private memory not to be
GUP=E2=80=99able by the kernel so that userspace can=E2=80=99t trick the ke=
rnel into
accessing guest private memory in a context where it isn=E2=80=99t prepared=
 to
handle the fault injected by the hypervisor. We=E2=80=99re looking at wheth=
er
we could use memfd_secret to achieve this, or maybe whether extending
your work might solve the problem.

However, during the porting effort, the main issue we've encountered
is that many of the details of this approach seem to be targeted at
TDX/SEV and don=E2=80=99t readily align with the design of pKVM. My knowled=
ge
on TDX is very rudimentary, so please bear with me if I get things
wrong.

The idea of the memslot having two references to the backing memory,
the (new) private_fd (a file descriptor) as well as the userspace_addr
(a memory address), with the meaning changing depending on whether the
memory is private or shared. Both can potentially be live at the same
time, but only one is used by the guest depending on whether the
memory is shared or private. For pKVM, the memory region is the same,
and whether the underlying physical page is shared or private is
determined by the hypervisor based on the initial configuration of the
VM and also in response to hypercalls from the guest. So at least from
our side, having a private_fd isn't the best fit, but rather just
having an fd instead of a userspace_addr.

Moreover, something which was discussed here before [3], is the
ability to share in-place. For pKVM/arm64, the conversion between
shared and private involves only changes to the stage-2 page tables,
which are controlled by the hypervisor. Android supports this in-place
conversion already, and I think that the cost of copying for many
use-cases that would involve large amounts of data would be big. We
will measure the relative costs in due course, but in the meantime
we=E2=80=99re nervous about adopting a new user ABI which doesn=E2=80=99t a=
ppear to
cater for in-place conversion; having just the fd would simplify that
somewhat

In the memfd approach, what is the plan for being able to initialize
guest private memory from the host? In my port of this patch series,
I've added an fcntl() command that allows setting INACCESSIBLE after
the memfd has been created. So the memory can be mapped, initialized,
then unmapped. Of course there is no way to enforce that the memory is
unmapped from userspace before being used as private memory, but the
hypervisor will take care of the stage-2 mapping and so a user access
to the private memory would result in a SEGV regardless of the flag

Now, moving on to implementation-specific issues in this patch series
that I have encountered:

- There are a couple of small issues in porting the patches, some of
which have been mentioned already by others. I will point out the rest
in direct replies to these patches.

- MEMFILE_F_UNRECLAIMABLE and MEMFILE_F_UNMOVABLE are never set in
this patch series. MFD_INACCESSIBLE only sets
MEMFILE_F_USER_INACCESSIBLE. Is this intentional?

- Nothing in this patch series enforces that MFD_INACCESSIBLE or that
any of the MEMFILE_F_* flags are set for the file descriptor to be
used as a private_fd. Is this also intentional?

Most of us working on pKVM will be at KVM forum Dublin in September,
so it would be great if we could have a chat (and/or beer!) face to
face sometime during the conference to help us figure out an
upstreamable solution for Android

Cheers,

>   - Move the private/shared info from backing store to KVM.
>   - Introduce F_SEAL_AUTO_ALLOCATE to avoid double allocation.
>   - Rework on the sync mechanism between zap/page fault paths.
>   - Addressed other comments in v6.
> v6:
>   - Re-organzied patch for both mm/KVM parts.
>   - Added flags for memfile_notifier so its consumers can state their
>     features and memory backing store can check against these flags.
>   - Put a backing store reference in the memfile_notifier and move pfn_op=
s
>     into backing store.
>   - Only support boot time backing store register.
>   - Overall KVM part improvement suggested by Sean and some others.
> v5:
>   - Removed userspace visible F_SEAL_INACCESSIBLE, instead using an
>     in-kernel flag (SHM_F_INACCESSIBLE for shmem). Private fd can only
>     be created by MFD_INACCESSIBLE.
>   - Introduced new APIs for backing store to register itself to
>     memfile_notifier instead of direct function call.
>   - Added the accounting and restriction for MFD_INACCESSIBLE memory.
>   - Added KVM API doc for new memslot extensions and man page for the new
>     MFD_INACCESSIBLE flag.
>   - Removed the overlap check for mapping the same file+offset into
>     multiple gfns due to perf consideration, warned in document.
>   - Addressed other comments in v4.
> v4:
>   - Decoupled the callbacks between KVM/mm from memfd and use new
>     name 'memfile_notifier'.
>   - Supported register multiple memslots to the same backing store.
>   - Added per-memslot pfn_ops instead of per-system.
>   - Reworked the invalidation part.
>   - Improved new KVM uAPIs (private memslot extension and memory
>     error) per Sean's suggestions.
>   - Addressed many other minor fixes for comments from v3.
> v3:
>   - Added locking protection when calling
>     invalidate_page_range/fallocate callbacks.
>   - Changed memslot structure to keep use useraddr for shared memory.
>   - Re-organized F_SEAL_INACCESSIBLE and MEMFD_OPS.
>   - Added MFD_INACCESSIBLE flag to force F_SEAL_INACCESSIBLE.
>   - Commit message improvement.
>   - Many small fixes for comments from the last version.
