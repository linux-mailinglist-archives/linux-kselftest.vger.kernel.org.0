It'd be nice if this could work. Though I think there's an inherent
problem (same as with fd) with trying to pass a reference back to the
user, while the user can concurrently modify that reference.

Let's assume that user space creates new copies of perf_event_attr for
every version they want, there's still a race where the user modifies
an event, and concurrently in another thread a signal arrives. I
currently don't see a way to determine when it's safe to free a
perf_event_attr or reuse, without there still being a chance that a
signal arrives due to some old perf_event_attr. And for our usecase,
we really need to know a precise subset out of attr that triggered the
event.

So the safest thing I can see is to stash a copy of the relevant
information in siginfo, which is how we ended up with encoding bits
from perf_event_attr into si_perf.

One way around this I could see is that we know that there's a limited
number of combinations of attrs, and the user just creates an instance
for every version they want (and hope it doesn't exceed some large
number). Of course, for breakpoints, we have bp_addr, but let's assume
that si_addr has the right version, so we won't need to access
perf_event_attr::bp_addr.

But given the additional complexities, I'm not sure it's worth it. Is
there a way to solve the modify-signal-race problem in a nicer way?

Thanks,
