At the moment, hugetlb support is required. Thank you so much for sending
this up. This has made things simple. I've replicated this same patch in
wp_huge_pmd() for huge pages.

I think with updated handling path updated in do_wp_page() and
wp_huge_pmd() in version, UFFD_USER_MODE_ONLY will not affect us.
