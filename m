Is anyone working on such a shim at the moment? Otherwise, would it make
sense for me to look into it? (although I'll probably need a pointer or
two for what is actually needed)

I saw your comment on Fuad's series [1] indicating that he'll also need
some shim, so probably makes sense to tackle it anyway instead of
hacking around it with #if-ery.
