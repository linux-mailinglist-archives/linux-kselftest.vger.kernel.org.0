I'm building a kernel with the following relevant configurations:

$ cat .config | grep VSYSCALL
CONFIG_GENERIC_TIME_VSYSCALL=y
CONFIG_X86_VSYSCALL_EMULATION=y
CONFIG_LEGACY_VSYSCALL_XONLY=y
# CONFIG_LEGACY_VSYSCALL_NONE is not set

Running the test without this change both in virtme and on real
hardware gives the following error:

# ./tools/testing/selftests/proc/proc-pid-vm
proc-pid-vm: proc-pid-vm.c:328: int main(void): Assertion `rv == len' failed.
Aborted

This is because when CONFIG_LEGACY_VSYSCALL_XONLY=y a probe of the
vsyscall page results in a segfault. This test was originally written
before this option existed so it incorrectly assumes the vsyscall page
isn't mapped at all, and the expected buffer length doesn't match the
result.

An alternate method of fixing this test could involve setting the
expected result based on the config with #ifdef blocks, but I wasn't
sure if that could be done for kernel config options in kselftest
code. There's also the matter of checking the kernel command line for
a `vsyscall=` arg, is parsing /proc/cmdline the best way to do this?
