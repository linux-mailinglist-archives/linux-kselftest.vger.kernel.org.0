So if I understand correctly what you are implying, is to have the int3
code be different for 32 bit and 64 bit? This would require handling
text_poke, ftrace and kprobes differently for the two. Or perhaps we
can build hacks on top.

Honestly, this sounds more of an argument for doing the buffered space
for all exceptions on 32 bit, because it removes one of the special
cases. If we were to move the frame and give it a full frame like
x86_64, then we can remove kernel_stack_pointer() altogether. I've hated
that function for some time, as I tripped over it in the past too, and
it keeps coming up. It's sad that regs->sp is unreliable as is.

IMO, getting rid of the kernel_stack_pointer() function is a positive
side effect of these changes.

But is it localize? It would definitely affect do_int3().

You are saying that we have a do_int3() for user space int3, and
do_kernel_int3() for kernel space. That would need to be done in asm
for both, because having x86_64 call do_int3() for kernel and
user would be interesting. Looking at the do_int3() code, I'm not sure
how to safely separate kernel and user int3 handlers if 64bit doesn't
call do_kernel_int3() directly. It may end up looking something like
this:

dotraplinkage void notrace do_int3(struct pt_regs *regs, long error_code)
{
#ifdef CONFIG_X86_64
	do_kernel_int3(&regs);
#endif
	/*
	 * Use ist_enter despite the fact that we don't use an IST stack.
	 * We can be called from a kprobe in non-CONTEXT_KERNEL kernel
	 * mode or even during context tracking state changes.
	 *
	 * This means that we can't schedule.  That's okay.
	 */
	ist_enter(regs);
	RCU_LOCKDEP_WARN(!rcu_is_watching(), "entry code didn't wake RCU");

#ifdef CONFIG_X86_64
#ifdef CONFIG_KGDB_LOW_LEVEL_TRAP
	if (kgdb_ll_trap(DIE_INT3, "int3", regs, error_code, X86_TRAP_BP,
				SIGTRAP) == NOTIFY_STOP)
		goto exit;
#endif /* CONFIG_KGDB_LOW_LEVEL_TRAP */

#ifdef CONFIG_KPROBES
	if (kprobe_int3_handler(&regs))
		goto exit;
#endif
#endif

	if (notify_die(DIE_INT3, "int3", regs, error_code, X86_TRAP_BP,
			SIGTRAP) == NOTIFY_STOP)
		goto exit;

	cond_local_irq_enable(regs);
	do_trap(X86_TRAP_BP, SIGTRAP, "int3", regs, error_code, 0, NULL);
	cond_local_irq_disable(regs);

exit:
	ist_exit(regs);
}

dotraplinkage void notrace do_kernel_int3(struct pt_regs **regs)

Or maybe I misunderstood what you envision :-/
