Sorry, vec_buf_index starts from 0 in each smaller page walk. Whatever we
put in vec_buf is copied to user buffer and cur_buf isn't copied until we
walk over next pages. This seems straight forward to me. But in case as you
are saying that we start putting cur_buf inside vec_buf itself, we'll have
to be careful that we don't copy the last element to the user as we'll be
readjusting it and may be doing addition in next small page walk.

-ENOSPC is being returned in form of true error from
pagemap_scan_hugetlb_entry(). So I'd to remove -ENOSPC from here as it
wasn't true error here, it was only a way to abort the walk immediately.
I'm liking the following erturn code from here now:

#define PM_SCAN_BUFFER_FULL	(-256)

UFFD_FEATURE_WP_ASYNC and UNPOPULATED needs to be set on the memory region
for it to report correct written values on the memory region. Without UFFD
WP ASYNC and UNPOUPULATED defined on the memory, we consider UFFD_WP state
undefined. If user hasn't initialized memory with UFFD, he has no right to
set is_written = false.

No, we only take read mm lock. We need to WP only those pages which have
been noted to be written, the page passed the filtering with all the masks
and page successfully got added to user buffer. This would break if we try
to decouple.

I've not seen any examples of this. But I've seen examples of returning
error if kernel doesn't support a feature. Each new feature comes with a
kernel version, greater than this version support this feature. If user is
trying to use advanced feature which isn't present in a kernel, we should
return error and not proceed to confuse the user/kernel. In fact if we look
at userfaultfd_api(), we return error immediately if feature has some bit
set which kernel doesn't support.

Agreed. But I'm using same names, start and len which mincore (a historic
syscall) is using. I've followed mincore here.

Found means all the pages which are found to be fulfilling the masks and we
have added it to the user buffer. I can add the comment on top of
pagemap_scan_private struct? But I don't think that it is difficult to
understand the meaning of found_pages and also we compare it with max_pages
which makes things very easy to understand.

I'm not sure which edge case you are referring to? Probably for hugetlb

No, it shouldn't be a selection criterion. I guess, right now I've wrong
implementation of this mask. Return mask should just mask the flags:

If user want to find the write status of all PRESENT pages, required_mask =
PRESENT and RETURN_MASK = WRITTEN. Thoughts?

Yeah, correct.

Your explanation is very thoughtful. Decoupling will surely help in making
things simpler and very easy to understand. I'll make the change to
decouple WP op from masks.

Probably the worse case of 6ce64428d6 is hitting and making writes slower:
