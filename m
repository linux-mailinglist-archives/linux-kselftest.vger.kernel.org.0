They might have a good reason for that "make mrproper", but it does
sound like a good avenue to investigate.  Otherwise, as noted earlier, my
thought is to clone the repo into a temp directory, run "make mrproper"
there, continue being a non-special user of kunit, and avoid messing up
people's databases and tags.
