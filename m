I do think it's useful, and here's my thought process...

Most filesystems have to take string path parameters in order to support
mount(2) and work with mount(8). Yes, fsparam_fd() will accept
FSCONFIG_SET_STRING by parsing it as a decimal string, but there are
only two users of fsparam_fd() and honestly I'm not convinced this is a
particularly sane API for anything other than strict backcompat reasons
(the API only makes sense as a file descriptor and you want mount(8) to
be able to use it).

So you end up with most parameters supporting paths set using
FSCONFIG_SET_STRING anyway, meaning in-kernel lookups can't be taken off
the table. And if we accept paths for lookup, then (for the same reason
we have *at(2) syscalls) it is preferable to allow specifying dirfds. So
FSCONFIG_SET_PATH should also be supported.

And as there is no infrastructure to block FSCONFIG_SET_PATH_EMPTY
arguments (yes, you can do it manually, but the *only* user of
fs_lookup_param() doesn't), then anything that accepts FSCONFIG_SET_PATH
currently also accepts FSCONFIG_SET_PATH_EMPTY which is "morally
equivalent" to FSCONFIG_SET_FD. So unless you block
FSCONFIG_SET_PATH_EMPTY then FSCONFIG_SET_FD should probably also be
supported (there is the re-opening distinction, of course, but that is
not relevant if you use filename_lookup() -- which is what filesystems
will do in practice).

So my impression is that most users (if they had an fsconfig(2) man page
to read...) would expect parameters that accept paths to either:

* Work with FSCONFIG_SET_STRING and FSCONFIG_SET_PATH only; or
* Work with FSCONFIG_SET_STRING, FSCONFIG_SET_PATH,
  FSCONFIG_SET_PATH_EMPTY, and FSCONFIG_SET_FD.

Currently, none of our parameters work that way.

 * ext4's journal_path takes FSCONFIG_SET_STRING, FSCONFIG_SET_PATH, and
   FSCONFIG_SET_PATH_EMPTY.
 * overlayfs takes FSCONFIG_SET_FD and FSCONFIG_SET_STRING.

I only fully realised how inconsistent this is while working on the
fsconfig(2) man pages -- at the moment I have a very long paragraph
explaining that there is this distinction in-kernel, but this really
doesn't seem intentional to me. I would be very confused as a user that
FSCONFIG_SET_PATH is useless for most filesystem *path* parameters, even
though the filesystem accepts them as FSCONFIG_SET_STRING.

As for practical uses, it would be nice to not have to open 500 files in
order to create a 500-layer overlayfs.
