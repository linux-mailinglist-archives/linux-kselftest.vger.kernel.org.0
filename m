Yeah, it can be done. But I've thought about it. It would look more uglier.
I'll have to subtract 1 from vec_len in the start and then add 1 in the
end. The current algorithm seems simpler.

Will remove it.

There is difference:
We add data to user buffer. If it succeeds with return code 0, we engage
the WP. If it succeeds with PM_SCAN_FOUND_MAX_PAGES, we still engage the
WP. But if we get -ENOSPC, we don't perform engage as the data wasn't added
to the user buffer.
